Following their remarks we will open the call to your questions. Before we conclude today's call, I will provide some important cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during this call. I would also like to remind everyone that today's call will be recorded and will be made available for replay via the instructions in today's press release in the Investors section of the Company's website.

David Raun
Thank you Abby. Good afternoon, everyone. We're grateful that you joined us today and I trust you, your families are staying safe, healthy, and virtually productive. Before addressing the solid financial and operating progress weâ€™ve made during the third quarter, I would like to acknowledge our team's continued effective response to the COVID pandemic.
The safety and the health of our employees continues to be a top priority. Our implementation of recommended CDC guidelines has kept our team healthy and products have shipped without disruption. Pandemic has impacted several of our key customers and suppliers limiting our top line revenue growth over the past two quarters.
As of Q3, we've identified $9.9 million in lost or delayed revenue compared to our internal annual plan attributed to COVID related matters. More than half of the shortfall was from our largest customer in a media and entertainment space. Despite lower revenues, our dedicated team produced better bottom line results for the quarter versus a year ago. They made great strides to cut expenses, improve efficiency and strengthen One Stop Systems' in the short term and more importantly for the future.
As John will outline shortly, our operating margin, EBITDA, net income all improved over the same quarter last year. I'm proud how the employees executed the expense reduction plan implemented in April and layered in new customers during this period. These efforts resulted in reducing our operating expenses by over $1.2 million year to date and we remain on track and committed to our target $2.5 to $3 million in cost reductions on an annual basis.
We exceeded our minimum guidance of $11.8 million that we provided our last earnings call coming in at $13 for the third quarter, but also producing strong gross margin of 38%.
Before I provide additional color and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Morrison, who will take us through the financial details for the quarter. Following John will be Jim Ison, our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer who will share some information on our exciting new products and discuss customer activity. John?

Thank you, David and good afternoon, everyone, I'm glad you can join us today. Earlier today we issued a press release with our results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020. The release is available in the investor relations section of our website at onestopsystems.com.
Our statement of operations shows that our revenue in the third quarter was $13 million up 12% from $11.6 million in the previous quarter and lower by 13%, compared to 14.9 million, in the third quarter of last year. The sequential improvement in Q3, as compared to our previous quarter was due to increased sales into the military, as expected for the second half.
