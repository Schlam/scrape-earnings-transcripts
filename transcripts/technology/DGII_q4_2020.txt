Thank you, Jamie and welcome to Digi internationals 2020 fourth fiscal quarter and end of fiscal year earnings call. We are pleased with both to finish to a record fiscal year and the excitement on our future potential. Our team achieved several new annual records, revenues, profitability, cash generation subscribers and annualized recurring revenue. We're able to accomplish all of these goals under the unprecedented heavy cloud of the pandemic. Digi's value proposition of remote, automated, zero touch and intelligently connected offerings has strengthened setting the stage for new records in the future. Consistent with our commentary from last quarter's earnings call, our fourth fiscal quarter performance demonstrated growth from the previous quarter and double-digit growth year-over-year. We maintain our new model over 50% gross margins. Over 15% adjusted EBITDA margins, pay down $15 million in debt, leveraging strong cash collections and exceeded 70,000 subscribers in SmartSense, our solutions business segment.
Inspired by the success of both SmartSense and Opengear, Digi has implemented the new organizational structure to bring focus to our key product lines. Kevin Wiley and Gary Marks continue to lead those respectable organizations. And we have implemented new leaders in Cellular Routers with Mike Ueland, OEM Solutions, our embedded product line with Steve Ericson; Infrastructure Management with Brian Kirkendall and Technology Services with Tracy Roberts.
