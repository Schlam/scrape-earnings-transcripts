Thanks, Joe. And thank you to everyone who has joined us today.
Now let's get to the third quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was 1.6 million compared to 1.7 million in the prior quarter and 3.9 million same quarter a year ago. Revenue for the third quarter continued to be impacted by extended government shutdowns related to the pandemic delaying renewals of our legacy business. We expect our legacy business to recover once conditions normalize.
Gross Margin in third quarter was 58.9% versus 60.7% last quarter and 62.1% in the third quarter 2019. Operating expenses were 2.3 million compared to 1.7 million last quarter and 0.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was 1.4 million compared to a net loss at 0.7 million in the prior quarter and net income of 1.5 million third quarter 2019.
