Thank you, operator and thank you everybody for joining. Let me begin the call by saying these are the most exciting times ever in the company and we are seeing -- we anticipate a transformation of the company coming soon as all of you must have read the acquisition announcements that we've made, definitive agreements that we have in the near future, we anticipate closing these deals in sequential form, as well as placing that inventory, online integrating and into our systems and having thousands and thousands of cars available for consumers in order to execute our hybrid strategy, which we believe will be in the top three to five as far as online focused automotive companies, having thousands and thousands of vehicles on the Internet.
So I'm going to begin by handing it off to Evan Bernstein to give some of the financial highlights and then Richard Aldahan, Chief Operating Officer will give you some of the sales and operational highlights, and then I'll continue and give you some light on the e-commerce and acquisitions and finance status of things. So thank you very much for joining again, and I'm going to hand it off to Evan Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer.

The growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by the increase in sales from sales type lease contracts and increased vehicle sales revenues. SG&A. we have invested heavily in our SG&A to accommodate our transformative growth in our acquisitions and e-commerce business. Acquisitions, consulting and legal expenses were $419,000 during the three months ending September 30, 2020 as compared to $280,000 from the previous quarter.

Richard Aldahan
Thank you, Evin. Hi everyone and thank you for joining the call. Let me start by saying that the entire LMP team and I are as energized and as enthusiastic as ever. Our company has never been in a better position than it is currently to execute upon our plan. We expect a complete transformation in the company's dynamics as we begin closing our contracted acquisitions and implementing our e-commerce hybrid offerings. We are seeing a continued and growing interest of dealerships that are seeking partnerships with us.
The LMP management team is positioning our business for strong growth in 2021. We are aiming to close several of our contracted acquisitions that we previously announced this quarter, and expect to have the inventory integrated into our e-commerce platform app lmpmotors.com and lmpsubscriptions.com within weeks of closing, and to launch our hybrid e-commerce model of home delivery, site to store, ship from store. We expect upon close the acquisitions will be immediately accretive to our earnings. Incidentally, our contracted acquisitions are significantly outperforming their 2019 profits by approximately 30% on 2020 annualized basis.
