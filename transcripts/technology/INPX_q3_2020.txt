In addition, to supplement the GAAP numbers, the company has provided non-GAAP adjusted net loss and net loss per share information in addition to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA information.

Thanks David, hello afternoon and welcome to our Q3, 2020 business update call. Before we get started, I just want to say that I hope you were all staying safe and doing well. As I know the pandemic is surging across many parts of the country. Most of our people are still working remotely from home and that continues to go well. I'd like to thank our amazing employees across the globe, who have adjusted their work and home life to keep us moving forward despite these challenges. I believe we are now better positioned than any time in our company's history to deliver on our business objectives.
