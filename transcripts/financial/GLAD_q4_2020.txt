Good morning and thank you all for dialing in this morning to discuss the results for Gladstone Capital for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, after which I’ll provide comments on the fiscal year as a whole and outlook for the current fiscal year. 
Originations for the quarter totaled $22 million, including one new proprietary investment; however, repayments and proceeds also totaled $22 million and included the exit of one proprietary investment and the sell down of one of our larger second lien positions, so assets were largely unchanged for the period.
Interest income rose to $11.9 million or 2.6% over the prior quarter, with the increase in average investments as the portfolio yield remained consistent at 10.9%. Prepayment and dividend income recovered with the resumption of more normal deal activities and lifted total investment income to $12.6 million, which was up $900,000 over last quarter.
