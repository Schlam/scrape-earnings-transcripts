Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Itaú CorpBanca's Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Claudia Montevecchi, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Claudia Montevecchi
Good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call for our third quarter 2020 financial results.
Before proceeding, let me mention that our remarks may include forward-looking information, and our actual results could differ materially from what is discussed in this presentation. I would also like to draw your attention to the financial information included in this management discussion and analysis presentation, which is based on our managerial model that we adjust for nonrecurring events, and we apply managerial criteria to disclose our income statement. This managerial financial model reflects how we measure, analyse and discuss financial results by segregating commercial performance, financial risk management, credit risk management and cost efficiency. We believe this form of communicating our results will give you a clearer and better view of our performance through these different perspectives. Please refer to Pages 9 to 12 of our report for further details.
Now, let's continue with the presentation. First, Mr. Moura will comment on 2020 second quarter results. Afterwards, he will -- we will be available for a question-and-answer session. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gabriel. With us today in this conference call in Santiago are Mr. Gabriel Moura, CEO; and Mr. Rodrigo Couto, CFO. First, Mr. Moura will comment on 2020 third quarter results, our strategy, as well as recent events. Afterwards, we will be available for a question and answer session.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gabriel.
Gabriel Moura
Thank you, Claudia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Itaú Corpbanca third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today's presentation has three parts. Our third quarter 2020 results, our early release results at the end of October and an update on our strategic agenda. So moving straight to Slide number 2.
As we showed on Slide 2, the macroeconomic outlook improved slightly in Chile and remained stable in Colombia. Our current expectation for Chile is a 5.5% decline in GDP this year, and 4.5% growth in 2021. The latest new vaccine has been positive, so we'll probably see an upward review, which may also include the second withdraw from the ESPs in Chile.
If you can please go to the next slide on Page 4. We have a loss of CLP10 billion in the third quarter, mainly as a result of the additional provisions we made to reinforce our balance sheet for this challenging credit cycle, according to our expected loss provisioning frame. Our revenues were impacted by low inflation, which was only 0.1% in the third quarter, as well as by lower revenues from derivatives, which had been very strong in the second quarter. On the cost management front, we made the biggest headcount reductions since the merger, which is a clear sign of our progress in the efficiency and simplification prompts, which we'll discuss more in the last part of the presentation.
Moving to Slide 5, we show that we continue to perform better than the market in mortgages and consumer credit, while we are growing our commercial portfolio less than the market. Commercial credit demand has been weak after the first wave of the FOGAPE program, and we have also been selective both in terms of risk, as well as in terms of required returns, in line with our focus of improving the return on capital.
