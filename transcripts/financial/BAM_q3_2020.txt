Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Brookfield's third quarter 2020 conference call. On the call today are Bruce Flatt, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Goodman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Murski, a managing partner in our Infrastructure Business and Chief Operating Officer of its North American operations.

Bruce Flatt
Thank you, Suzanne, and good morning everyone on the call. Starting with our operating performance in the third quarter, and Nick will get into it in detail but I'll just make a few comments. We earned record operating FFO during the quarter, in fact higher than any other quarter in our history. This demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our combined asset management franchise and the quality of our operating businesses today.
And I would also note that we're just starting our way out of this recession and not all of our businesses are performing where they should be. The strong operating performance across these businesses was driven by excellent results, in several of our private equity businesses, some of which benefited from strong demand and pricing from new housing starts which snapped back after the lockdowns in the spring.
Consistent with previous quarters, our infrastructure and renewable businesses continued to deliver very steady results back by a 100% availability of all of those assets. Those businesses that didn't see volume decreases in the first half of the year such as our ports and toll road businesses saw recoveries during the quarter as government eased restrictive measures.
Within our real estate business, office rent collections remained at normal collection levels and investment demand for this asset class is strong and soon to get stronger. Just this last month, we entered into an agreement to sell one of our London office properties at a 9% premium to the price we paid for half the property just 12 months ago.
