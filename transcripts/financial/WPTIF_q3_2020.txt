Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WPT Industrial REIT's Conference Call. This conference call is being recorded.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that during this conference call, management may make statements that contain forward-looking information. This forward-looking information is based on a number of assumptions and is subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those disclosed or implied. We direct you to the company's earnings release, MD&A and other securities filings for additional information about these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties.
Now that the formalities are out of the way, I would like to turn the meeting over to Scott Frederiksen, Chief Executive Officer of the REIT. Please go ahead.
Scott Frederiksen
Thanks, Keith. Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Judd Gilats, the REIT's CFO and Matt Cimino, the REIT's COO. Before we dive into our detailed results, I want to provide a few high-level comments on the quarter and the U.S. industrial markets more generally. While broader uncertainty, whether from COVID-19, geopolitics or otherwise continues to impact and influence the overall U.S. economy, we've seen increasing strength in U.S. industrial market and continued cap rate compression in most of our investment markets, as reflected in our own strong operating performance and increases in the fair value of our portfolio.
And looking ahead to the remainder of this year and into 2021, we expect to see continued positive momentum on the leasing front with discussions actively underway on a number of larger renewals and expansions and accelerating growth in our private capital platform.
With that preview, I'll now turn things over to Judd to discuss the REIT's financial results in more detail. Judd?
Judd Gilats
Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, let me remind everyone that all figures discussed today are stated in U.S. dollars. Total investment properties revenue for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30 increased 55.5% and 47.7% over last year, primarily due to 2019 and 2020 acquisitions with additional contributions from increases in base rent.
The REIT also earned management fee revenue of approximately $900,000 and $1.3 million in the quarter and year-to-date, respectively as we saw increased construction management fees in the third quarter. Net operating income for the 3 and 9 months ended September 30 was up 52.2% and 45.0% from last year. Same properties NOI, while impacted by 2.4% reduction in occupancy, was up 1.7% and 1.8% for the 3 and 9 months, driven mainly by favorable releasing spreads and contractual rent increases. G&A expenses for the 3 and 9 months excluding any fair value adjustments were approximately 3.0 and $9.3 million.
FFO and AFFO for the quarter were up 48.7% and 43.5%, respectively. FFO and AFFO per unit were $0.253 per unit and $0.197 per unit, respectively. Both FFO and AFFO were mainly impacted by acquisitions in 2019 and 2020, increases in base rent in the legacy portfolio and by a reduction in general and administrative expenses from the prior period. Offsetting these increases were reduction in management fees attributable to a variation in in-promote income, a reduction in occupancy and the impact of a 41.3% increase in the weighted average number of units outstanding compared to the same period last year.
