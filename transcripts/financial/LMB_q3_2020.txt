Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Limbach Holdings announced its 2020 third quarter results and filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Today, the company will be reviewing those results and providing an update on current market conditions. The company may also refer to a slide presentation accompanying this earnings call. The presentation can be found in the Investors section of the company's website at www.limbachinc.com. The company encourages everyone to review the forward-looking statement disclosure on slide 2 of the presentation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie Bacon, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Limbach Holdings; and Jayme Brooks, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.

Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're excited to review our third quarter performance with you and to take your questions. During the quarter, Limbach again generated solid financial and operating results. We're pleased with where we are, but we still see multiple opportunities to deliver even better results as our focus on operational execution becomes further ingrained in our core processes. We remain on track for a successful year, and we're excited to be able to increase our financial guidance for 2020, which I'll address at the end of our prepared remarks.
First, I want to take a moment to thank the more than 1,700 employees at Limbach for taking on the challenges of the past nine months with focus and passion. During the year, they've adapted rapidly and smartly to these challenges and continue to press on. It's been quite a period. We rose through the challenge and are staying focused on staying safe, getting cash to protect our liquidity position and getting work through creative sales strategies. It's impressive to watch and to be part of to all my fellow, Limbach team members. Thank you.
As a result of your efforts, we're in a good position as we get ready to enter 2021. From a macro level, we continue to deal with the broader environment, which has no shortage of economic, political and public health challenges. To date, that's mostly been just noise, though. We credit our success this year to the market diversity of the business and the strength and fortitude of our employees and workforce. The three tactical areas of focus I mentioned above, staying safe, getting cash and getting work, are leading to one of our best years. Nonetheless, we continue to evaluate a spectrum of potential scenarios that could impact the business, so that we're prepared to the extent possible.
We need to remain flexible and responsive. Although there has been an increase in COVID cases in many of the geographies we operate in, we have also realized additional market opportunities. These include increased filtration, improved air circulation, and restart processes for building systems and equipment as facilities reopen. Over the last several months, we've seen a meaningful increase in opportunities on the service side as building orders staying true to the new normal cause by the pandemic.
