Juan Carlos Mora
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our conference call for the third quarter 2020. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy.
During the third quarter, Colombia ended the mandatory preventive isolation. The country is now facing the double challenge of containing the second peak of infections while at the same time, gradually reopening the economy.
The data have shown that September was the best month since the start of the health crisis, reflecting a better performance of agriculture and mining sectors, complemented by the reactivation of retail and construction, activities that have benefited from more freedom of movement in the main urban centers.
While we are still in a very uncertain environment, during the third quarter, Bancolombia performed better than the previous one. The net income for this quarter was COP280 billion.
Before getting to the details of the results, I want to mention two key topics. First, regarding credit risk, we recorded 31% less provision charges compared to the second quarter of this year as a reflection of better economic activity and the increase of mobility in the main cities of the country.
The cost of risk decreased during the quarter, but it still reflects weak economic outlook related with the pandemic. This provisioning level and the lag in NPLs formation results in a coverage ratio of 232% for the quarter.
The second point is regarding our digital strategy for Bancolombia. Digital transformation is a continuous process and a medium to generate solutions that meet the needs of people and companies. This has a higher goal to promote sustainable economic development to achieve well-being for everyone.
