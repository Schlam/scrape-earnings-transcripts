Operator
Good morning, and welcome to this ABN AMRO Third Quarter 2020 Analyst and Investor Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Robert Swaak, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
Robert Swaak
Thank you very much, and good morning, and welcome to ABN AMRO's Q3 results. As always, I'm joined by Clifford Abrahams, our CFO; and Tanja Cuppen, our CRO.
This time is different as each of us is dialing in from different locations, which reflects the reimposed lockdowns here in the Netherlands and also the U.K. It shouldn't impact our results call though, but please bear with us during the Q&A session.
You'll understand that our focus today is in our Q3 financials. I'll share Q3 highlights, update you on economic developments and our good progress on my priorities, including the wind down of CIB noncore. We'll present on strategy and longer-term plans and outlook at our investor update at the end of November. Clifford will go through the details of the third quarter results and run you through capital, and Tanja will then update you on developments in our loan portfolio, including Q3 impairments and our latest guidance on full year 2020 cost of risks.
So turning to the highlights. The Dutch economy has proven to be resilient as society adapted to limit the spread of COVID-19. The Dutch government has the financial clout to sustain large-scale support measures, and these measures indeed have been effective. Very happy to see that our impairments this quarter are moderating, and the bank is returning to profit.
Over the full year, we now expect impairments to be below the EUR 3 billion guidance we gave last quarter and closer to our Q1 guidance of EUR 2.5 billion. We remain cautious, however, looking forward, interest rates remain low. Our NII is under pressure despite further action we are taking on charging negative rates.
Our capital position is robust despite significant further TRIM add-ons this quarter. I now expect Basel III to convert to Basel IV largely by the end of 2021. And during this period, we will continue to face capital headwinds and uncertainties.
I think we should ask everyone to go on mute.
Operator
I'm sorry sir. I'm having technical difficulty. I thought everybody was on mute. Just one moment, sir.
Robert Swaak
All right. No worries. Why don't I pause until we are sure that everyone's on mute.
Operator
Thank you very much, sir.
Robert Swaak
Will you give me a sign to go ahead, or should I wait?
Operator
Yes. Yes. Just a second, sir. I'm having some technical difficulties.
Robert Swaak
Okay. Just in case anyone is now joining, and you're wondering why there's this silence, I think we're dealing with -- the operator is dealing with an issue on muting everyone. So I'll wait until I hear back from the operator before I continue.
Operator
It's almost there, sir. Thank you.
Robert Swaak
All right. No worries.
Operator
Okay. Thank you, sir, for your patience. Go ahead, sir.
Robert Swaak
Thank you. So let's also make sure that -- I hope you all callers go on mute until we're in Q&A, that might help.
So let me just pick up where I left off. I was talking about the expectation of Basel III to convert to Basel IV, largely by the end of 2021. And so during this period, we will continue to face capital headwinds and uncertainties. COVID-19 is a big example of this. So I do remain cautious in coming quarters.
