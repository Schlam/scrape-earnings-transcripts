Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the SmartCentres REIT Q3 2020 Conference Call.
I would like to introduce Peter Forde. Please go ahead.
Peter Forde
Thank you. Good afternoon. I am Peter Forde, President and CEO. And joining me on the call today are Mitch Goldhar, our Executive Chairman; Peter Sweeney, Chief Financial Officer; and Rudy Gobin, EVP, Portfolio Management and Investments.
The call will begin with comments by Mitch and myself; followed by Peter Sweeney, who will talk about our results for the quarter-end, including IFRS valuations, liquidity and accounting provisions for bad debts. And then we will take your questions.
Our comments will mostly refer to the outlook and mixed-use development initiatives sections of our MD&A, which are posted on our website. I refer you specifically to the cautionary language on pages three and four of the MD&A material, which also applies to comments any of the speakers make this afternoon.
Some of what you hear today, you may have heard before. Our focus is on operating our existing shopping centers and on creating value through real estate development. This process and the value it creates is not conducive to a quarterly reporting cycle. And while we have a significant amount of development projects underway, each has its own timeline. We are staying on course and on strategy within the context of real estate development, this strategy is moving us forward nicely with the rewards starting this past quarter with the SmartVMC condo closings.
The last six months were unusual for all of us. The spread of the pandemic and the accompanying shutdown impacted every one of us personally and from a business perspective to varying degrees. Our REIT was no different. The pandemic added some challenges in the short-term, but our focus remained on our long-term strategy. We were intensely fixated on our initiatives to grow the business through mixed use development.
Short-term challenges required our attention and assisting our tenants, keeping our shopping centers operating effectively to take care of more than 60% of our tenants, which are considered essential services that remained open even at the peak of the shutdowns. These tenants were a priority for us as they were meeting food and other essential needs of communities. Our attention was on assisting our retailers in getting back to opening their stores once the lockdowns were lifted, such that almost a 100% of our tenants were open and operating at the end of the quarter. This percentage was down slightly in October as a result of select new shutdowns.
All the way through the pandemic, we remain very focused on our longer term strategy of development. Mitch’s vision 30 years ago to build retail centers with Walmart as an anchor involve many detailed steps just as does today’s mixed-use plans, as well as building and operating company around it. The culture of our company is unique and that we are land development people, operating shopping centers.
We are and always have been comfortable with land, its possibilities and its path to profit. This is our core competency. It is right now and in the foreseeable future that our core competency will differentiate us as we work on the new path intensifying and repositioning, many of our strategically located properties. Another way of saying this, we are a real estate development company that owns many great shopping centers with substantial and reliable recurring income, most of which we developed.
