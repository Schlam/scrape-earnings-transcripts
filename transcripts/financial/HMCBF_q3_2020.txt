Thank you Jill. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter results conference call. This year, our earnings call is taking place on November this day. Every year on this day we take time to remember and to honor men and women who have served and continue to serve our country, to secure for us all the privileges of freedom and peace. May we all remember to keep a moment of silence at 11:00 AM in their honor.
I hope you all continue to be in good health and good spirits through these unprecented times. Home is reporting another quarter of solid results today as we continue to manage through the impact of COVID-19 on our economy and our industry. I will speak with you about some of our accomplishments this quarter, our progress on deferrals and our IGNITEs Program. Then Brad will take you through the financials in more detail and we will conclude with a question and answer session.
As a company on Home Trust has a lot to be proud of this quarter. Our originations reached nearly 2 billion, a meaningful increase over Q3 last year, reflecting strength in both our residential and commercial segments. We delivered an interest margin of 2.51%, while keeping non-interest expense lower on a sequential basis.
We delivered return on equity of 14.7% and increased our industry leading CET1 ratio sequentially to 19.35%. We concluded the disposition of the point of sale component of our retail lending portfolio. And we continued to make progress towards our strategic objective objectives, including our IGNITE project, as we prepare our company to be a leader in the financial industry of the future. All of this happened, while keeping the health, safety and security of our partners, customers and employees.
