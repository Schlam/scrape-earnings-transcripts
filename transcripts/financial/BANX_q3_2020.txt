Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon and welcome to StoneCastle Financial's third quarter investor call for 2020. Here with me today is Pat Farrell, our CFO and Julie Muraco, Investor Relations.
During todayâ€™s presentation, I would briefly comment on the banking industry and credit markets before commenting on the company. Then I'll provide StoneCastle Financial's quarterly results and portfolio review, and Pat will provide you with greater detail on our financial results before we open the call for questions.
During the past two weeks, we saw several banks reporting better than expected earnings for the third quarter and many banks are signaling that they are well-positioned to withstand a prolong economy recovery. Furthermore, banks are well-capitalized and for the most part have adequate reserves in anticipation of an increase in corporate defaults.
The government stimulus issued in Q2 helped many businesses weather the third quarter and we will believe that any additional stimulus going into 2021 will have the potential impact of keeping corporate default rate lower than expected. 
Going into Q4 and first half 2021, our outlook for the banking industry remains cautiously optimistic. As of this call and some exceptions, StoneCastle's underlying banks have reported third quarter results. Banks in our portfolio reported median net income up 8.4% versus the second quarter. In addition, our portfolio banks reported average Tier 1 capital ratios of 12.4%, flat from Q2.
Finally, StoneCastle's underlying banks reported change in median reserves up 5 basis points to 1.27% and loan book growth was up 7.8%. I want to take a moment to mention some interesting statistics on community banks regarding the PPP stimulus program.
The Independent Community Bankers Association reported that community banks exponentially serve their local and rural communities, by providing PPP loans to 98% of the economically distressed or low-income counties and to approximately 97% of the rural counties receiving such loans. Overall, community banks were the dominant PPP lenders serving approximately 58% of our PPP participants and 48% of all U.S. small businesses.
