John Bailey
Thank you, Sylvie and good morning everyone. Welcome to BSR REIT conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2020. I am joined by Susie Koehn, our Chief Financial Officer. And also with us today are Dan Oberste, President and Chief Investment Officer; and Blake Brazeal, our Co-President and Chief Operating Officer who will both be available to answer questions following our prepared remarks.
I'll start this call by providing an overview of our Q3 performance and other corporate developments, Susie will then review the financials, and I'll conclude with some comments on our outlook and strategy. After that, we will hold a Q&A session.
Before we begin, I need to remind listeners that certain statements about future events made on this conference call are forward-looking in nature. Any such information is subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the cautionary statements on forward-looking information in our news release and MD&A dated November 10th, 2020 for more information.
During the call, we will reference certain non-IFRS financial measures. Although we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information about our financial performance. They're not recognized measures and do not have standardized meanings under IFRS. Please see our MD&A for additional information regarding our non-IFRS financial measures including for reconciliations to the nearest IRFS measures. Also please note that all dollar amounts are denominated in U.S. currency.
We continue to operate our business with relatively minimal disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our residents and BSR team members. Management will continue to monitor all of our markets and properties to adjust policies and procedures as necessary to providing safe environment to live and work.
Our rent collections remain within the pre-COVID historical levels, specifically during Q3 2020, we collected 98% of the total monthly revenue compared to our historical average of 99%.
We continue to advance our capital recycling program. On July 30th, we acquired Broadstone Park West constructed in 2014, a high-quality property in Houston market with 370 suites for $51 million or $137,838 per apartment unit.
On September 24th, we acquired Aura Castle Hills constructed in 2019, a 276-suit garden-style residential community in the Dallas Fort Worth market for $51.8 million or $187,681 per apartment unit.
Subsequent to quarter end, earlier this week, we continued the recycling program with the sale of six non-core properties comprising of 1,483 apartment units; four in Little Rock, Arkansas; and two in Houston, Texas, generating gross proceeds of $130 million. We are very pleased with the progress of the capital recycling program.
