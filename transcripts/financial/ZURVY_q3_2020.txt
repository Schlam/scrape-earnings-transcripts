Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Zurich Insurance Group Q3 Results 2020 Conference Call. I am Alessandro, the Chorus Call operator. [Operator Instructions].
At this time, it is my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Richard Burden, Head of Investor Relations and Rating Agency Management. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard Burden
Good morning, and good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's Third Quarter 2020 Q&A Call. On the call today is our group CEO, Mario Greco; and our Group CFO, George Quinn. As usual, for the Q&A session, so we kindly ask you to keep to a maximum of 2 questions.
But before we start the Q&A, as usual, with the Q3, George will make a few introductory remarks before going on to your questions. George, I pass over to you.
George Quinn
Yes. Thanks, Richard, and good afternoon, good morning to everyone. I mean, over the third quarter, the group overall has successfully managed, I mean, what have been a series of unprecedented challenges related to COVID-19, not only that, but a global recession and, of course, a record number of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. 
We've continued to deliver strong growth in Property & Casualty. That's driven by commercial insurance, but we've also seen our life business return to growth in Q3. In the P&C business, pricing momentum in commercial remains strong, both in North America and in other regions, and we expect this to continue through the remainder of this year and into next, which will support further improvement in the underlying accident year loss ratios.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with our conservatively calibrated Z-ECM solvency returning to the midpoint of the 100% to 120% target range. I might be over saying, we think the Z-ECM has served us well. It's informed our decision to move away from interest rate-sensitive life business already over a decade ago.
Having said that, the high level of calibration and conservative assumptions that underpin the model, I think we believe cause unnecessary uncertainty. Therefore, we intend to change reporting from the fourth quarter to focus on the Swiss solvency test ratio. It's obviously still conservative, but it's much more aligned to metrics that you see reported by peers.
From a COVID-19 perspective, you'll have seen already today that we've reported claims, net of the associated frequency benefits, an unchanged level since the end of the first half at $450 million. And I think as you know from earlier in the crisis, we've worked hard to further clarify wordings of the policies. We knew and today I'm happy and I'm confident that we only have limited exposure to any new developments in the pandemic.
The combination of flexible and resilient business model and the increasingly evident and through of higher commercial pricing, it gives me great confidence that we'll emerge strongly from this year's disruption and be in a strong position to take advantage of new opportunities as they present themselves.
I'm now happy to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session\
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley.
Jon Hocking
I've got two questions, please. Looking at the rate momentum, particularly in the North America business, can you give a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing sort of 3Q and 2Q and how that might be impacted by the top of mind that you're seeing renewals in the 2 quarters? That's sort of first question.
