Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And on behalf of KBC Group, a very warm welcome. Today is Thursday, November 12, and you're listening to the conference call of KBC's third quarter results. As usual, we have our group CEO, Johan Thijs; as well as our Group CFO, Rik Scheerlinck with us. And they will both elaborate on the results and add some additional insights.
As such, it's my pleasure to give the floor to our CEO, Johan Thijs, who will quickly run you through the presentation.
Johan Thijs
Thank you, Kurt. And also from my side a warm welcome on the disclosure of the third quarter results for KBC Group. And I will take you to the slides. And as always, we start with the key takeaways, which start with the presentation of an excellent result, almost €700 million to be precise, €697 million in this third quarter.
Now the reason for this excellent result is obviously driven by the fact that KBC has been or that the engine has been firing on all its cylinders. So we have a very strong performance on the commercial side on both the bank and the insurance activities. We have seen our customer loans and customer deposits increasing year-on-year. We have seen our interest income in very difficult circumstances but the low interest rate environment have seen continuous growth. And we have seen strong interest – net interest margins.
We had a slightly higher net fee commission also showing and translated into net sales in the third quarter, which is quite exceptional, when I compare that with the previous two years 2018 and 2019. We have an excellent result on the insurance company. And once again the confirmation that the diversification effect of the bancassurance model of KBC Group is paying off again.
We have done what we promised namely, working on strict cost management and that has translated in a further decrease of our cost side with 2.7%. The loan impairments are also perfectly in line with the guidance which we have given. Actually, they're pretty much better. And the consequence of all those bits and pieces summed up together is translated in a very strong capital ratio and liquidity ratio.
Therefore, in summary, I could say, this is an excellent quarter with a return on equity of 15% on a very elevated capital level. Let's not forget that. So 15% on a 16.6% capital position is indeed not too bad.
Let me go through the details on the different topics and as usual, we start with the one-offs. So it is only one important one-off to mention that is we have booked €26 million on the net interest income side for a correction on the booking of inflation-linked bonds in the insurance company. All the rest remains intact.
We have about €4 million or €6 million one-off on the tracker mortgage activity or the tracker mortgage pack in Ireland for out of the €6 million are related to the tracker mortgage fine of €18 million, of which we already had booked €14 million in the past.
As I already said, the bank insurance activity is indeed a diversifying factor in difficult times. The insurance company always stands solid and have therefore mitigates the impact of the -- for instance interest rate environment on the banking side. This has also translated into a 22% contribution on the result via the insurance company and that is mainly contributed by the non-life insurance company.
