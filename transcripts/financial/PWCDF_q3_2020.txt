Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to our quarterly analysts and investor call. It's great to have you with us today. Thanks for joining us.
Just to open it up with the regular disclaimer statements on forward-looking statements on page two. And also disclaimer on page 3 regarding non-IFRS measures. And so, with -- today in addition to myself I’ve got Greg Tretiak, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Power Corporation.
And I will just open the comment up by talking a bit about the third quarter. No question, this was a quarter where Power and its major operating businesses made really big strides in advancing our value creation agenda. Our major public companies had strong financial results in the face of the COVID-19, and at the same time announced a number of highly attractive transactions that are not only strategic, but very accretive to earnings on the whole and value-enhancing.
At the Power level, we continued to make good progress in building out our investment management platforms, as well as enhancing value of our standalone businesses. And all the while across the group, at the public operating companies and at Power, we continue to push forward on our efforts to enhance our communication to the market participants, both in terms of the content the way we present and in terms of the frequency of the meetings.
So, on page 6, you've got the fact that each of Great-West Life, IGM and GBL, have had their earnings out and their own calls or releases. And the point of this call is not to repeat the material that was presented by them. Rather than that what we're going to do is provide our perspective on some of the key developments and then talk about some of the developments at the Power Corp. level itself.
Moving along to slide 7, I think, the word frenetic is probably not inappropriate, when you talk about what's been announced over the last few months. There were five pretty significant transactions for them at the operating companies, plus the Wealthsimple announcement just after the quarter end, some -- and really significant, I think, in these deals in many ways. I'm going to address them in the pages that follow. So, I'm not going to go through them on this page, but you can just see the piece of activity. And this didn't all happen, obviously, in the third quarter. People at Great-West, at IGM across Power have really been working extremely hard on many of these, and they fell into place in this quarter. But, lots of people have been working for a long time to make all of this a success.
I do want to point out one thing on the page, which is not a transactional announcement, but the leadership changes that IGM, and my first chance to kind of publicly acknowledge what went on there at IGM. And first of all, thank Jeff Carney, and recognize what Jeff did from 2013 to September, when we announced his retirement as CEO of IGM. And what he did really for IGM was fantastic, in terms of helping to reposition Mackenzie and its leadership position, helping Barry McInerney and the team, done a great job of continuing to build on really setting IG Wealth up for future success, putting in place an incredible team. And then finally, when he was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's, dealing with that in a way that allowed us to go out and properly plan how we were going to replace him and in effect, build on what he had done. And so, Jeff has done an incredible job. And we're lucky that although he's no longer in a management position, we're going to benefit from his ongoing counsel and as an advisor to IGM and to the group.
