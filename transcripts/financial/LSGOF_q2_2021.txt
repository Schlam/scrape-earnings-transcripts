Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome to the live webcast of Landsec's 2020/'21 interim results. Now this morning's presentation will follow the usual structure, although for reliability purposes, in this second lockdown, certain elements are prerecorded. So I will provide an overview of the results for the period and the key themes affecting our market before Martin takes you through the financial review and Colette covers the portfolio.
Martin's and Colette segments have been prerecorded. Then following brief remarks on outlook and the summary, we will open up for a live Q&A, where both Martin and Colette will join me on the line.
Now when we delivered our full year results on the 12th of May, I was 4 weeks into my new role, we were all 7 weeks into our first lockdown. Nonessential retail was still 5 weeks away from reopening, the hospitality sector still 8 weeks away. As we now deliver our interim results 6 months later, we are in the first week of a second national lockdown. Nonessential retail and hospitality are again closed, having been open for no more than 21 and 18 weeks, respectively, between lockdowns.
So it has been an extraordinary 6 months. But I believe we can begin to take some positives from our experience and the situation we find ourselves in. The business and more importantly, the people in it have demonstrated beyond question, their ability to respond effectively to a crisis. Our approach throughout has been and remains to be realistic, proactive and to act responsibly. Despite the significant challenges of the past 6 months, the business remains in a fundamentally strong position, particularly financially, with a low 33% loan-to-value ratio and good portfolio liquidity.
London has come back from many crisis over the centuries and even now remains an attractive location for investors, underlining the importance of our Central London portfolio and its quality, resilience, and liquidity. As a result of this fundamentally strong position, we are pleased to be reinstating our dividend alongside these results. And we can also begin to look beyond COVID to medium- and longer-term opportunities that we expect to emerge. Increased obsolescence of older offices and major mixed-use/regeneration are 2 areas where Landsec is particularly well placed to create value. And all of this, of course, is reflected in our new strategy, which was launched at our Capital Markets Day 3 weeks ago.
I mentioned that our approach to managing the impact of COVID has been to be realistic, proactive and to act responsibly. Let me give you a little more color. Firstly, the safety of everyone working in or visiting one of our properties has been and continues to be our #1 priority. We implemented COVID secure plans for our entire portfolio with the first lockdown, and we've adapted them with care, as restrictions have changed. Secondly, there is no question in my mind that our relationships with our customers have been strengthened by the need for us to collaborate. And this will set us up well for the future. Whether that is through the launch of our GBP 80 million customer support fund, the sensible dialogue regarding rent concessions or deferrals, all the way in which we have helped office and retail occupiers alike with their own COVID secure measures, our collaborative approach has without doubt been a positive feature of COVID.
