Good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our Q3 results and outlook. I'm very pleased to have Jim Rudyk, our new CFO, joining me this morning. Jim joined AGI in late September, and brings an impressive career across several industries, with experience including finance and operational roles that bring relevant experience to AGI. As we move into the next stage of our growth, the experience Jim brings to the table, will be critical in navigating and implementing improvements in our system, operations, and bringing leadership to our global finance teams to facilitate our ongoing growth. 
We will start with a summary of the quarter, then discuss the significant accrual we are taking in the quarter, and close with a detailed review of a regional results, fundamentals, and outlook. Just a quick reminder that the cautionary language about forward-looking information and the use of non-IFRS measures contained in our Q3 release, also applies to the discussion during today's call.
As indicated over the prior three quarters, 2020 has been setting up for a Q3 weighted performance, with our commercial production schedules weighted to Q3. A relatively short and early harvest across North America, also contributed to the Q3 weighting. However, the COVID crisis acted to significantly offset these positive elements in the quarter, with a material impact on commercial projects globally. Development of commercial projects slowed, or projects were postponed due to the varying regional conditions due to COVID. 
Our customers have been dealing with limited access to sites, availability of resources, and uncertainties in end markets, which all contributed to lower our commercial sales globally, and in particular, in North America. That said, our commercial sales remained at 94% of Q3 2019, and 92% year-to-date versus 2019. All factors taken together, and at a consolidated level, Q3 2020 was a record third quarter for AGI in terms of sales and adjusted EBITDA. It was also a record quarter overall for adjusted EBITDA, just beating Q2 from 2019, which was our prior high watermark. This strong performance in the quarter, again highlights the benefits of our diversification in investments over the prior five years, demonstrates the resiliency of our business, and confirms our place in the global food infrastructure, with demand fundamentally driven by global consumption. 
Now, before we get into the details of our results, we'd like to address the incident that occurred during the quarter. On September 15, we reported that there was a collapse at a customer's project of a commercial grain storage bin that was manufactured by AGI. The cause and the responsibility for the incident, has not been determined, and there is an investigation underway. As disclosed this morning, the company has taken a $40 million accrual in the third quarter, in accordance with accounting and other disclosure obligations, on the basis of potential remediation of equipment that was supplied by AGI to this commercial facility, and one other facility. The accrual represents AGI’s estimate, in consultation with our external advisors, of the direct costs involved, including cleanup and equipment remediation at the two sites. AGI's contracts contain exclusions for indirect or consequential damages.
