Thanks, Adrienne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Turning to Slide 5. I'm very pleased with the third quarter financial results that we announced yesterday. I want to start with a few opening remarks about how the diversity of our business has been a crucial factor in delivering strong financial performance since the onset of the global pandemic.
Despite operating in a challenging environment for most of the year, we've delivered over $4 billion of core earnings year-to-date and our net income is comparable at $4.1 billion. This is a testament to the diversity and resilience of our business model as well as to the importance of the investments that we've made in our digital transformation over the last few years.
In Asia, we rank as the top three pan-Asian player. We have insurance operations in 11 markets with over 115,000 agents. We have more than 100 bank assurance partnerships, of which eight are exclusive and provide us with access to over 14 million customers.
