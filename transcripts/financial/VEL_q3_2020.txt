Thank you, Matt. Hello everyone and thank you for participating in Velocity Financial third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Farrar, Velocity's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Szczepaniak, Velocity's Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this afternoon, we released our third quarter 2020 press release and the accompanying earnings presentation, which are available on our Investor Relations' website.
I'd remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the Company's control and actual results may differ materially. For discussion of some of the risks and other factors that could affect results, please see the risk factors and other cautionary statements made in our communications with shareholders, including the risk factors disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports.
Also note that the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today and we do not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements.

Thanks Chris. And thank you all for joining us today. We had a great quarter and I’m excited to host the call today. On our last earnings call, I outlined our plans to restart originations in the third quarter, and I'm very excited to report that we are completely operational. Our new applications have returned to pre-COVID levels and the pipeline is expanding rapidly.
The silver lining of our production pause was a chance to work on the nice to have projects that are often tough to accomplish when a company is growing. We use the downtime to reevaluate our entire production platform and we made significant improvements to our process as well as our technology.
These improvements will make us more efficient and more customer friendly going forward. We also restructured job functions and responsibilities, which resulted in a reduction of force at the end of September. All these decisions are never easy. Our team is convinced they were necessary and beneficial to our future growth.
In terms of the portfolio, we saw a stabilization of the non-performing loans and our asset managers continued to do an excellent job of resolving delinquent loans. We continued to see strong recovery rates and the real estate markets are performing better than many had predicted.
Additionally, it's important to note that we saw provision expense return to a normalized level in Q3 as the economy is performing above the adverse levels that we were assuming in our CECL model. Looking forward, our team is working hard to create new relationships on the liability side of the balance sheet to eliminate mark-to-market risk and explore other debt structures to finance our growth during the fourth quarter and well into ‘21.
