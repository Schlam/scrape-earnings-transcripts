Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 call this morning. Since the onset of COVID-19, we have been focused on steering Sienna through the spices, always with the health and well-being of our residents and team members being at top priority. Eight months into the pandemic, we are continuing with the relentless efforts to fight COVID-19 and to minimize the impact of new outbreak.
While we continue to manage through a very difficult environment, we were able to adjust and strengthen our operations and become more knowledgeable and better prepared in a response to the second wave. We continue to invest in our frontline teams and processes, strengthen the way we communicate and expanded our leadership team. In order to further strengthen clinical quality and resident safety measures across our platform, our board of directors established a quality committee to focus on the quality of resident care and resident experience. This also includes resident and team member satisfaction, safety and many other initiatives directed towards improving the quality of our residents’ life.
I'm very pleased that Dr. Andrea Moser joined Sienna as Chief Medical Officer. In her role she's focused on leading and implementing all aspects of medical services, improving our resident quality platform and building on Sienna's virtual care capabilities so that physicians can come to the bedside of our residents by technology, enabling access to broader range of medical expertise.
In addition to Dr. Moser, we continued to receive advice from some of Canada's premier healthcare experts, including Joe Mapa, the former President and CEO of Sinai Health System, Dr. Allison McGeer, one of Canada's premier infection prevention and control specialist, and Mary Jane Dykeman, an expert in healthcare risk management. We're also in the process of joining Seniors Quality Leap Initiative, an initiative that helps us to benchmark our quality indicators against international standards and allows us to participate in the sharing of best practices, all with a goal of improved clinical quality and quality of life for our seniors.
