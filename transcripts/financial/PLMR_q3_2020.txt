Good morning, and welcome to Palomar Holdings, Inc.'s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference line will be opened for questions with instructions to follow at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Uchida, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Chris Uchida
Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation in our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me here today is Mac Armstrong, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder. As a reminder, a telephonic replay of this call will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 18, 2020.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that, this call may contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include remarks about management's future expectations, beliefs, estimates, plans and prospects. Such statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by such statements, including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Such risks and other factors are set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update such forward-looking statements. Additionally, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance.
The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Mac.
Mac Armstrong
Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. I hope those of you with us today continue to be safe and healthy. Today, I'll speak to our third quarter results at a high level and speak to our operations before turning the call over to Chris to discuss the financial results in more detail. For the third quarter ended September 30, 2020, we experienced several notable achievements.
First, the momentum of our business remains strong, as evident in our year-over-year gross written premium growth of 55.4%, figure that included meaningful growth across several product lines as we've increased our position as a specialty insurance leader.
Second, Palomar access and surplus insurance company, or PESIC, our newly established surplus lines insurer launched in August inbound policies across several lines of business during the third quarter. We believe PESIC will only enhance our ability to pursue profitable growth and respond favorably to a further hardening rate environment.
Third, during the quarter, we continued to expand our distribution network, executing several new partnerships in line like Residential Earthquake and Flood and roll out new products to existing and new distribution partners.
Fourth, we sustained our commitment to building a world-class team and grew our headcount by 10%. Among the key additions to our team, we welcome Jason Sears and experienced E&S Casualty and programs insurance executive as Senior Vice President of Programs to lead our program business as well as the scaling and diversification of PESIC.
