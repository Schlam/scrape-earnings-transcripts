Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. With me on the call today are Dave Bjarnason, our Chief Financial Officer; and Megan Sophocles, our Senior Vice President and Treasurer.
As with many businesses during COVID, our offices remain closed and we're taking this call from remote locations. We apologize in advance for any connectivity issues or inconvenience that may cause.
The purpose of our call today is to review MMA Capital Holdings 2020 third quarter financial results and to provide an overall business update. Our third quarter report was filed with the SEC on Monday, and an updated investor presentation is available on our website.
For our call today, I will begin my prepared remarks with a brief overview of our quarterly results, followed by a summary of our investments in depth. I'll then turn the call over to Dave for a more detailed review of our financial performance. 
And before we wrap up our prepared remarks and open the call for questions, I'll provide a general update of the company's CEO selection process, as well as operating and capital plans for the near-term, as we continue to navigate a period of great uncertainty for the U.S. and global economies.
With respect to the financial results, we reported that the company’s adjusted book value per share increased by $0.71 to $38.08 during the third quarter. As Dave will further discuss, this 1.9% increase was primarily driven by our core investments in renewable energy. 
The company’s investments in loans to finance the development and construction of renewable energy projects in the United States represented approximately 70% of the company’s total assets at quarter end. Nearly all of which are made through the Solar Ventures where the company invest alongside an institutional capital partner. 
At September 30, the carrying value of the company's renewable energy investments was $363.7 million approximately the same as that recorded at June 30. Year-to-date, the carrying value of these investments has increased $74.1 million, primarily due to net contributions of $45.8 million and $27.6 million of investment-related income. 
As you will see in Table 3 of our filing, the company recognized $9.3 million of income related to its renewable energy investments during the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, we have realized an unlevered net return on these investments of 11.1% for the period ended September 30, compared to 11.8% for the period ended June 30.
