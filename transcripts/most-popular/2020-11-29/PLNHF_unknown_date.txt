Thanks Mark. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter call.
Q3 was our best quarter ever, and a demonstration of the resiliency, flexibility and strength of our business model SuperStore and Planet 13 as a whole. Despite the ongoing pandemic, and Las Vegas being at less than 50% tourist occupancy compared to the same period a year ago, we generated 22.8 million in revenue, 36% higher than our highest quarter ever. Once again, we're responsible for 9% of the state's total sales. And this is continuing into Q4, with October posting another month for over 7.5 million in revenue.
This improvement has been driven by operational changes we've made throughout Q2 to adapt to COVID-19. We introduced delivery which contributed 3.3 million in the quarter exclusively from local residents. We improved SuperStore throughput, refined marketing towards locals and tourists, resulting in higher traffic and ticket and 18.5 million of revenue from the SuperStore. We've also launched our brands in the rest of the states our fewer wholesale channel and an additional $1 million of revenue during the first full quarter of the wholesale sales.
The SuperStore performance has given us the competency to continue to build on what is working. On October 13, we announced the addition of non cannabis retail continuing to build out the SuperStore. The non cannabis retail space will sell Planet 13 merchandise and general sundries.
