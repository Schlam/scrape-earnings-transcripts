Aaron Milford
Well Elvira it is great to see you, it is great to be here. As we were talking just a few moments before we came on, it would be great to be able to do this in person, but absent that I think this is next best alternative, so happy to be here.
As far as opening comments, I will keep them pretty brief Elvira and save as much time for your questions as we can. But just sorting on, 2020 has been a challenge. And I think we just have to acknowledge that it is not news, but from our perspective here at Magellan, we actually still believe performed pretty well. All things considered very resilient.
Our business has shown to be very resilient. We are dealing with some demand issues. But we think that is going to turn, 2020 has been challenging, we think we have performed very well. We think a lot of resilience has been built into our business over the years as shown itself, frankly.
And then, as we look forward, so let’s get 2020 behind this, as we look forward, we are very optimistic around here, we are going to have some opportunities to continue to create value for our investors and our business we think will rebound nicely.
And hopefully 2020 is just going to be sort of uplift in what continues to be a very long-term value creating propositions for our investors. So, acknowledging 2020 stuff, we think we have done pretty well and we are anxious and optimistic about what the future holds for us.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Elvira Scotto
That is great. Since we will start with this, but can you maybe provide an update on refined products demands across your different regions? How do you see the uptick in COVID-19 cases and that potential shutdowns affecting demand in your region?
Aaron Milford
Right. So for us, just to recall, the predominance of our system runs through the mid-con part of U.S. so Texas all the way up to North Dakota, out to Denver, and I will pass it on the West. We are right here in sort of the heart of the country.
So for us, when you think about us regionally, I think as we have talked about it a few weeks ago, it is really a rural story versus a metropolitan story for us. So, let’s go back and just talk overall. What we talked about a few weeks ago which is what do we expect from our business overall, and I will talk a little bit more about those two areas.
And if you look at fourth quarter, our base business includes, our current demand and also drilling in West Texas. If you combine all that, we think it is going to be down about 13% from 2019 levels, if you compare that to 4Q 2019.
And if you looked at the components of that, we think our gasoline is going to be down around 8%, our base distillate is going to be down around 12%, and jet fuel is going to be down 50%. Something to keep in mind for us is just an important part of what we do, but it is a smaller part of what we do compared to gas and diesel. So, the fact that is 50% it is not a great fact, but in the grand total in the schema things , it is not moving the dial.
