Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us today for Twist Bioscience's conference call to review our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and full year financial results and business progress. We did issue our financial results this morning which is available at our website, www.twistbioscience.com.
With me on today's call is Dr. Emily Leproust, CEO and Co-Founder of Twist. Emily will begin with a review of recent progress on Twist businesses. I will report on our financial and operational performance, and Emily will discuss our upcoming milestones and direction. We will then open the call up for questions. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. The audio portion will be archived in the Investors section of our website and will be available for one week.
During today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or future financial or operating performance. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in financial periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include those set forth in the press release we issued earlier today as well as those more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we cannot, at this time, predict the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting business or economic impact. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Dr. Emily Leproust.

Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year 2020 has been a transformative year for Twist. In early December of last year, we reported our results from fiscal 2019 and provided revenue guidance of $80 million to $84 million for fiscal 2020. While we withdrew that guidance, given the uncertainty of the pandemic and the closure of many customer sites, extremely pleased to report record revenues of $90.1 million for fiscal 2020 and $32.4 million for the [Audio Gap]
Our strength in revenue was driven by the innovation and commitment to execution from our entire team at Twist. They worked through exceptional, uncharted circumstances to deliver great products to our customers. Against the incredibly disruptive backdrop of the COVID global pandemic, we delivered growth in our product lines and added new products to specifically address the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus.
I'd like to note that unlike some of our peer companies, our record revenue is not a function of COVID-19-related products. And in fact, while our synthetic RNA control for SARS-CoV-2 and our NGS panel to sequence the virus definitely contributed to our revenue, it is our stable Synbio and NGS products with growing initial revenue from our Biopharma division that has catapulted our success this fiscal year. Illustrating our momentum, we reported record orders of almost $117 million for the full-year, with $42.3 million for the fourth quarter, setting the stage for growth into 2021.
