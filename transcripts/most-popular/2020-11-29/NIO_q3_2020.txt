ES6 has been the fastest selling electric SUV in China for 13 consecutive months. ES8 has reached the number one in sales this year in the premium electric SUV segment, priced above RMB400,000 in China. Our third product EC6 has started the deliveries in September. We have gained and maintained a great word of mouth reputation for our product quality and service and continuously received positive feedback from our users.
In the 2020, China new energy vehicle experienced index released by J.D. Power in September, NIO has once again ranked highest in any new vehicle quality among all brands.
After the launch of the battery as a service or product, NIO's products and the services have been increasingly accepted by more users.
