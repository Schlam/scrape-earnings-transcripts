Thanks, Becky. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report our results for the fiscal year ended September 30.
Fiscal 2020 was a successful year for Monmouth. During the year, we acquired five brand new, highly automated Class A built-to-suit industrial properties containing 1.2 million square feet for a total cost of $175.1 million. In keeping with our business model, all five properties are leased long-term to investment-grade tenants. These acquisitions will generate annualized rental revenue of $10.9 million and have a weighted average lease term of 13.9 years. During the fourth quarter, we acquired one property for $15.2 million, consisting of a newly constructed 121,000 square foot distribution center. This distribution center is situated on 22 acres in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and is leased to Amazon for 10 years. This 22-acre site has ample expansion capacity and is ideally located immediately north of the Will Rogers World Airport.
With regards to our current acquisition pipeline, our pipeline grew over the quarter, and we've now entered into agreements to purchase six properties for $338.4 million comprising 2.4 million square feet of new Class A built-to-suit industrial buildings situated on 416 acres. Upon closing these transactions, our larger pipeline will represent a 10% increase in our gross leasable area. Four of these properties are leased to FedEx. Our largest deal is leased to Home Depot for 20 years, and one is leased to Mercedes-Benz. These future acquisitions will have a weighted average lease term of 15.3 years. Subject to our due diligence, we anticipate closing each of these transactions upon completion and occupancy. Five of these transactions are scheduled to close during fiscal 2021 and one is scheduled to close in early fiscal 2022.
