Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Conference Call. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.

Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Arrowhead's results for its Fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
With us today from management are President and CEO, Dr. Christopher Anzalone, who will provide an overview of the quarter; Dr. Javier San Martin, Chief Medical Officer, who will discuss our clinical programs; and Ken Myszkowski, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give a review of the financials. In addition, James Hassard, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Dr. James Hamilton, who is recently promoted to Senior Vice President and Head of Discovery and Translational Medicine will both be available during the Q&A session of today’s call.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that comments made during today’s call contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including without limitation those with respect to Arrowhead's goals, plans, and strategies are forward-looking statements.
These include statements regarding our expectations around the development, safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, projected cash runway, and expected future development and commercialization activities. These statements represent management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain, thus, actual results may differ materially. Arrowhead disclaims any intent and undertakes no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements discussed on today's call.
You should refer to the discussions under Risk Factors in Arrowhead's annual report on Form 10-K and the company’s subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for additional matters to be considered in this regard, including risks and other considerations that could cause actual results to vary from the presently expected results expressed in today’s call.
With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris Anzalone, President and CEO of the company. Chris?
Christopher Anzalone
Thanks, Vince. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This is our final earnings call in 2020, so in addition to discussing our progress for the quarter and plans for 2021, I would also like to speak a bit more broadly about our philosophy and model. 
We are building a different kind of biotech company. We are not focused on a single therapeutic area or rather on any disease with unmet medical need that is addressable with our technology. We are not focused solely on rare diseases or rather address large and small populations.
