Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. During the third quarter of 2020, we successfully completed the annual maintenance and several technology improvement project at our polysilicon manufacturing facilities. We have resumed full production in August with excellent operational results. For the third quarter, we produced 18,406 metric tons of polysilicon, among which approximately 97.7% was mono-grade.
We continued our relentless drive to lower production cost and reached to a record-lower cost in Renminbi terms. During the third quarter, we completed our digital transformation project, with a fully digitized manufacturing system that allow us to continuously improve our process control and analyze our manufacturing data so as to achieve better results in system stability, manufacturing efficiencies, production cost and product quality in the future. As our facilities are now running with increased efficiency, we expect to achieve a higher production volume of approximately 19,500 to 20,500 metric tons in the fourth quarter, with a potential cost reduction by approximately 3% as compared to the third quarter.
