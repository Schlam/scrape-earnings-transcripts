Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Before diving into the details of the quarter, I'd like to highlight our priorities, as we continue to navigate through this dynamic environment. Since the founding of our company, our focus has always been on the customer. Fast forward over 100 years, that's never been more important.
In this moment of retail disruption, the key to success is moving with speed and flexibility to adapt to the rapid changes in customer expectations. We're thankful for our team's ability to quickly pivot to serve customers in new ways, positioning us well to capture market share and generate value for our shareholders in the years to come.
To that end, we will continue to amplify the potential of both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands, with an emphasis on accelerating growth and improving returns. To achieve these goals, our focus is on fulfilling our customers' needs for both convenience and connection, by offering a seamless and personal experience everywhere they shop.
As we look across the business, we prioritized three areas where there is significant potential for growth. First, we're building on the success of our market strategy, which we now consider our company blueprint and how we operate to better serve customers on their terms, gain market share and increase inventory efficiencies.
By linking our digital and physical asset at the market level, we're able to offer customers up to 7 times more merchandise selection with two-day delivery or next-day order pickup. We have now reached scale in 10 of our top markets, which account for more than half of our sales, and we'll continue to roll out our strategy across our top markets.
Another component of our market strategy is to provide customers with more convenient access to our services. We know that when customers engage with us through order pickup, alterations or styling, their overall spend increases by up to 5 times.
In October, we expanded our capabilities, so customers can now pick up their nordstrom.com, nordstromrack.com and HauteLook orders at nearly 350 Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack locations in the United States. In addition, we recently opened a fourth local Nordstrom neighborhood service hub in the Los Angeles market, with a fifth location opening later this year.
