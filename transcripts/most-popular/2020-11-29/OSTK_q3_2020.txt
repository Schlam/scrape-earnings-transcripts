Thank you, Alexis and good morning to all. I am excited to be sharing our third quarter results and providing updates on our business. I'll follow the agenda on slide three. Next slide please. Because many of you are new to Overstock, I am going to start with an overview of who we are. We are a leading and innovative e-commerce company. We view ourselves to the tech company at our core, one that embeds automation in our processes and works to remove middle men.
We were founded as an online liquidator in the late 90s, then working through a general merchandiser and today are a home furnishings focused online retailer. A lot has changed at Overstock over the last 14 months. We've significantly upgraded our leadership team. We've defined who we are and identified what we do well. We've carved out a strategic niche where we want to play and we've introduced more and more discipline and focus into the organization. All that work is paying off.
The operational improvements we've made have allowed us to take advantage of recent sector tailwinds. We've made good progress, but we still have plenty of work to do. We're just getting started. I've never felt as confident about our ability to achieve what I said we would; sustainable, profitable growth. In fact, I'm so confident I will add something to that goal. For now on, our mantra is sustainable, profitable market share growth. Slide 5 please.
