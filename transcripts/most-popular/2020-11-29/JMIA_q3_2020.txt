Thank you very much. Welcome everyone and thanks for joining the call. I hope that you are all staying safe and well. About a year ago, we took several decisive actions in order to accelerate our path to profitability and strengthen our foundation for long-term success. Those were not easy decisions to take and implement, but they are now starting to pay off, in this despite a very volatile environment in Africa, where COVID-19 has rather been a headwind for us so far. Today we bring results, which show that we are very well positioned and that our path to profitability is becoming clearer and clearer. I want to thank all our teams, all our partners for their discipline, their dedication and hard work. We are immensely grateful for their continued support. Together, we are on a great mission to make e-commerce successful in Africa as was the case elsewhere in the world and drive positive impact in the process.
Let’s turn to Page 3. We have been very consistent in the strategy outline to the markets. Now, I appreciate this may sound a little bit repetitive to some of you, but I think it’s very important to reiterate that the strategy remains unchanged. It’s the balance of four pillars, growing the usage of our platform, driving the penetration and development of JumiaPay, gradual monetization and cost efficiency. Obviously, those four pillars are linked to each other and to some extent, conflicting with each other. And we manage this equation on a dynamic basis, placing more or less emphasis on each pillar as we progress. Everything we do is geared towards building a very strong platform with a very strong foundation to create long-term value.
If we take a look at some of the key actions and I’m now on Page 4, some of the key actions that we took about a year ago and how they positioned us for the years ahead. First, we have initiated in late 2019, a business mix rebalancing. In older to place more focus on everyday product category, drives higher consumer lifetime value and to support margins. The result of this action is, we have increased the diversity of our product mix category, we have reduced reliance on phones and electronics, which went from 56% to 43% of GMV in Q3 and we have gained more than 500 basis points of gross profit. Our gross profit was 7.3% of GMV in Q3 last year, now it’s 12.4%.
