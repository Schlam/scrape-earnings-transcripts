Thanks Jason, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We have had a strong growth in Q3 with total sales volume reaching 251,000 units, a 67.9% year-over-year increase. The sales volume in the China market reached 245,000 units, a 70% year-over-year increase, whereas the volume in the international market reached 560,000 units, a 6.3% year-over-year increase. In the first three quarters, our sales volume reached 451,000 units, an increase of 43% compared with last year. Now our strong growth in China was driven both by the market factors and our operational performance in the new product rollout, marketing, and channel expansion.
First, let me quickly comment on overall market landscape in China.Now, the overall electric bicycle market has increased by 30% to 22 million units in the first nine months, according to the Ministry of the Industry and Information Technology. This increase was driven by three factors. First, the post COVID-19 sentiment led to a high demand of individual mobility devices as more people find electric bicycles a more convenient, safer means for their daily commute. 
Now, second, with the adoption of 2019 China electric bicycle standards, more cities started to regulate this industry with license plates, removal of uncompliant products, and such created a safer environment for the users. And lastly, with lithium ion battery costs continuing to decline, the electric bicycle with portable lithium ion batteries become more affordable. It was estimated that 20% to 30% of electric bicycles this year are lithium versus 10% to 15% in 2019.
