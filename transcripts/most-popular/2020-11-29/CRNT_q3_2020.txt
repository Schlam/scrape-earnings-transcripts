Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. With me on the call today are Ran Vered, our Chief Financial Officer; and Osi Sessler, Head of Investor Relations.
Before getting into the quarter, I hope that you, your loved ones, your coworkers are healthy and well. Here at Ceragon, the health and safety of our employees continues to be our top priority. We're managing well in the new normal, with all departments continuing at full speed.
As you can see from the results, Q3 was a stronger period for Ceragon. Our revenues were $70.6 million, nearly back to pre-COVID levels, and our gross margin was above 33%, the highest it has been in more than a year. This combined with lower operating expenses gave us a profitable quarter, in line with our focused. Our performance reflects the market with a stronger than ever need to increase network capacity as the world goes increasingly online to shop, walk and socialize. It also reflects the complexity and operating difficulty of COVID which is still strongly with us. The need for broadband is driving urgency for building new 5G networks, expanding 4G networks, and extending ISP service into additional areas.
