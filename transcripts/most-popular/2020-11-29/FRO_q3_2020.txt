Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to Frontline’s Third Quarter Earnings Call. This is my first call in the hot seat. I’m both excited and honored to serve our companies in this capacity. Frontline’s long-term strategies are well cemented by the board and we run a very professional organization that has easily adapted to this management transition. This has been a volatile quarter and an extraordinary year-to-date. I’m tempted to bring in back zones, but they seem to become common to the shipping industry. The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected us all. And even though we still need to endure the situation a bit longer, there is no glimmer of hope in the horizon.
Let’s have a look at the highlights on Slide 3. Frontline came into Q3 2020 on a high note, but as the quarter progressed, freight rates started to increase. We still landed the quarter of good returns on a load-to-discharge basis earning $49,200 per day on our VLCCs, $25,100 per day on our Suezmaxes, and $12,800 per day on our LR2/Aframaxes. This yielded a net income of $57.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. Our adjusted net income came in at $56.4 million, rounded to $0.29 per diluted share.
We are very happy to report that Frontline has entered into three term loan facilities of up to $485.2 million. Inger is with me here today will elaborate more on our financing activities later in this presentation. So far in the fourth quarter, we have about 74% of our available VLCC days of $22,600 per day, 61% of our available Suezmax days up $12,600 per day and 65% of our LR2/Aframax days up $13,800 per day. The booked earnings are a reflection of the challenges this market faces. And although we want to be upbeat from the future, there are uncertainties going forward. Frontline has therefore decided to refrain from paying dividends this quarter to preserve the company’s cash position.
I’ll now let Inger take you through Frontline’s financial highlights.
Inger Klemp
Thanks, Lars. And good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentleman. Let’s now turn to Slide 4 and look at the income statement. Frontline achieved total operating revenues, net of voyage expenses of $178 million in the third quarter and also an adjusted EBITDA of $108 million in the third quarter. Frontline reported net income of $57 million, or $0.29 per share, and adjusted net income of $56.4 million, or also $0.29 per share in the third quarter. The adjusted net income this quarter decreased about $160 million compared to the previous quarter. And that was primarily driven by a decrease in our time charter equivalent earnings due to the lower reported TCE rates that Lars went through in the third quarter with also more of five days in this quarter due to dry docks of four vessels.
We also recorded a $13.9 million increase in ship operating expenses that was mainly due to increase in dry docking costs of $4.3 million also increased in repairs and maintenance of $2.1 million and we also had $4.8 million additional crew costs due to COVID-19. In addition, we also had a reduction of $12.4 million as a result of that we [Technical Difficulty] in the second quarter [Technical Difficulty].
Let’s then take a look at Slide 5. We have completed loan facilities in a total amount of approximately $920 million during 2020, whereof $725 million out of that was fund to refinance four existing loan facilities, which were due in December 2020 and the first half of 2021. But also, we have completed two financings over $196 million to finance new vessels. All these loan facilities were done at attractive terms with LIBOR plus 190 basis points or even better, maintaining our competitive cost structure.
