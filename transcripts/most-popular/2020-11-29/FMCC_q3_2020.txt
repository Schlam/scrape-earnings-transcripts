Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Freddie Mac’s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Jeff Markowitz, Senior Vice President of External Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Markowitz
Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for a discussion of Freddie Mac’s third quarter 2020 financial results. We’re joined today by our CEO, David Brickman; General Counsel, Ricardo Anzaldua; CFO, Chris Lown; and CAO, Jerry Weiss. Before we begin, we’d like to point out that – Freddie Mac executives may make forward-looking statements based on assumptions about the company’s key business drivers and other factors.
Changes in these factors could cause the company’s actual results to vary materially from its expectations. A description of those factors can be found in the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today. Freddie Mac executives may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about those measures, please see our earnings press release and related materials, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of freddiemac.com.
Our commentary today will be limited to business and market topics. As you know, we cannot comment on the upcoming election, public policy or legislation concerning Freddie Mac. The call is being recorded, and a replay will soon be available on freddiemac.com. We ask that this call not be rebroadcast or transcribed. At the end of Mr. Brickman’s prepared comments, we will open the call for questions that pertain only to the earnings statements we just released. As a reminder, this call is from the media and only they may ask questions.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Freddie Mac’s CEO, David Brickman.
David Brickman
Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. It’s a pleasure to be speaking with you today about Freddie Mac’s strong performance and the work we’ve done to support the housing market and families affected by the pandemic. While we continued to focus on stabilizing the market, we also drove important work in other areas from advancing sustainable housing to making the smooth transition to a new reference rate.
As a result, we again demonstrated the vital role we play in good times and bad acting as a countercyclical force in times of crisis and bringing private-market solutions to difficult challenges in all economic environments. I think you’ll see those themes woven through the three topics I address today. First, I’ll update you on our ongoing effort to provide stability during the pandemic, while we continue working to make the housing market better and more accessible. Second, I’ll discuss our financial results for the quarter. Finally, I’ll preview our outlook for both the single-family and mutlifamily markets over the near to medium-term.
First, let me provide an update on pandemic-related work and other actions we’ve taken to stabilize and improve the housing market. Few companies are as well-positioned as Freddie Mac to blunt the housing impact of COVID-19, and we continued to do just that. Our data shows that the vast majority of Freddie Mac borrowers who have fallen more than 60 days behind on their mortgage payments during the pandemic 96.1% to be exact have enrolled in forbearance, and that figure is even higher among minority borrowers at 97.6%.
