Thank you, operator, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. As you all know, we had high ambitions for this year, and as the financial results of the first six months of the year indicated, 2020 was lining up to be a banner year for WidePoint.
Today, I’m pleased to report that the financial success of the first half of the year has continued through the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2020, our revenues increased 94% year-over-year to 57.5 million, largely driven by our increased work on the U.S. Census 2020 as well as expansions with other Federal Government customers.
Perhaps, more impressive, our managed services revenue, which maintains approximately 50% gross margins, increased 38% year-over-year to 12.5 million. As a result of the increase in high margin revenue, we recognized net income of 1.1 million this quarter, which is almost five times the net income we recognized in all of fiscal year 2019.
Our EBITDA increased 102% year-over-year to 1.6 million, and our adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.7 million for the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, our cash position increased to 11.4 million.
While many of the financial improvements this year are driven by our major contracts, which we will provide updates on momentarily, the fact of the matter is, we will not be able to perform on those contracts if it were not for the incredible work of our dedicated personnel and the effective organizational structure that this management team began making more flexible and more efficient back in 2017.
I will take this opportunity to thank our employees who have been working remotely and for all the hard work that they have put in to make this year what it is shaping up to be.
WidePoint’s adaptability, which has been elucidated by our year-to-date accomplishments during the most challenging operating environment in recent memory, is among the key reasons we remain confident in our ability to continue improving this organization for the betterment of our customers and our shareholders.
