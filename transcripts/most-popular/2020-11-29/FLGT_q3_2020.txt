These forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates based on current views and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, matters discussed in any forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that may cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements.
The company assumes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements it may make today to reflect actual results or changes in expectations.

Please review the more detailed discussions related to these forward-looking statements, including the discussions of some of the risk factors that may cause results to differ from those described in these forward-looking statements contained in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the previously filed 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 which is available on the company’s Investor Relations website.
Management’s prepared remarks, including discussions of earnings and earnings per share contain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States or GAAP.
Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes they may be useful to investors for various reasons, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for/or superior to the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Please see the company’s press release discussing its financial results for the third quarter of 2020 for more information, including the description of how the company calculates non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share and a reconciliation of these financial measures to income and income per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
