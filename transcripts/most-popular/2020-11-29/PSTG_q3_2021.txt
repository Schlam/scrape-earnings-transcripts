Charlie Giancarlo
Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. As we look to the end of 2020 with relief and look forward with high hopes for a brighter 2021, my thoughts are with all of you on this call. I hope that you, your families, colleagues and friends are all staying healthy and faring well. The challenges and the changes we've experienced this year have been extraordinary and seem never ending. And they have certainly reset all of our expectations and assumptions. COVID has been the change agent of this decade and we have all learned many lessons in stamina and resilience.
Like you, I am excited about the many reports on the fantastic progress with vaccines and therapies created by the world's scientists, doctors and engineers. However, we all know that there will continue to be challenges due to the virus and its economic impact for months to come for all of our communities and stakeholders.
Through all of the challenges that COVID created this past year, Pure has been there for our customers delivering capacity, performance and services that enabled our customers to cope and thrive during the crisis. I feel confident that regardless of the rate of progress in the battle against COVID, Pure and most of our customers have turned the corner on their plans and ability to operate in this new normal.
