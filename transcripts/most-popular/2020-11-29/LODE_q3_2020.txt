Good day, and welcome to the Comstock Mining Q3 Update Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Corrado De Gasperis. Please go ahead, sir.
Corrado De Gasperis
Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. This is Corrado, CEO of Comstock on the line with Zach Spencer, our Director of External Relations and our Treasurer and we welcome you to Comstock Mining’s third quarter 2020 conference call.
I will provide a brief summary of the information included in our press release from this morning, including our progress on our strategic initiatives, especially with our mercury remediation business and the monetization of our non-mining assets, which has really picked up some incredible momentum. If you don’t have a copy of today’s release, you will find a copy on our new Web site at www.comstockmining.com by just click on the Press Releases link on the main menu bar. We’ve also filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q last night, which is also available on the Web site as well as the EDGAR on www.sec.gov.
Please also let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements on this call, including an update on the remaining 2020 outlook and also looking forward into 2021 and beyond. Any statements relating to matters that are not historical fact may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are also subject to the same risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in previous reports filed by the company and with the SEC and in this morning’s press release, and all forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to those same and other risks that we can't identify.
All right, let's jump right in. I tried to sort of shorten my prepared remarks, hopefully, allow a little bit more time for Q&A. But going into our update, with the closing of the sale of Lucerne, which we did complete in September, our realignment and all the work that really has been going on over the last two to three years, is essentially complete with some very positive financial implication. Let me summarize about a half of dozen of those or more for you.
First and foremost, we did record an $18.3 million gain on the sale of Lucerne, which resulted in net income this quarter for the three months ended of $17.3 million or $0.54 per share. We also recorded net income year-to-date of actually $18.3 million for the nine months ended or $0.63 per share. The company doesn't expect to pay any federal income taxes on these gains and/or incomes based on our existing net operating loss position. As most people know, the company has over $175 million in net operating loss carry forwards that stems back 15 years of exploration and development and those are our NOL carry forwards, if you will.
Total Assets as of September 30th grew to over $48 million that's a remarkable number and it includes about $26 million in current asset. This compares to current liabilities at that same period end of $6.6 billion. And remarkably, we've already paid down about $3 million of that $6.6 million just in the last 30 to 40 days. So from a balance sheet perspective, our net assets I don't think have ever been stronger. The $26 million in current assets includes investments in Tonogold's common and preferred shares that was as of 9/30 and they were valued at almost $10 million. It also includes 12% cash paying coupon convertible note receivable from Tono of $4.475 million that's due in just about 10 months. The company expects to monetize all of these assets within the next year.
