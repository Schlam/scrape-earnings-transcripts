Gary Chapman
Thank you. Welcome, everybody. You can find our earnings release and slide presentation on our website at knotoffshorepartners.com. Partnership owns and operates shuttle tankers where our ships transport oil from offshore production units to shore side and are an essential part of the supply chain for our customers, all of whom are large names in the oil and energy market.
Our call today will include the non-U.S. GAAP measures of distributable cash flow and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation amortization, EBITDA. The earnings release includes a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. And please remember that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties that are further discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings. Actual events and results can differ materially from those forward-looking statements, and the Partnership does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements, and I refer you to Slide 2 and our 2019 20-F for further details.
Onto Slide 3, our third quarter 2020 highlights. The partnership is again proud to report one of its best ever set of quarterly results driven by 100% fleet utilization and no schedule downtime in the quarter. Total revenues were $71.3 million, operating income $30.9 million and net income $25.1 million. We declared and paid cash distribution of $0.52 per common unit now for the 21st successive quarter. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $53.3 million for the quarter with distributable cash flow of $28.9 million and our robust coverage ratio of 1.6.
At the end of the quarter, the partnership had $585 million, the remaining firm contracted forward revenue, excluding options. We're again able to report that we've not experienced any material business interruptions or material adverse financial effects arising from COVID-19. And we continue to focus on the health and safety of our crew and the safety of our operations. The charter of the Windsor Knutsen will redeliver the vessel to us on November 25, 2020. And today, there are new rechartering opportunities under active discussion for commencement in 2021. Whereby, the partnership would also seek one or more short term charters for the vessel in an intervening period.
On this basis, and given the diversification of our charter portfolio, our strong distribution coverage and our available liquidity. The partnership does not currently anticipate this exploration will have a material adverse effect on the partnership's financial position in 2020, or 2021. Even if utilization of the Windsor Knutsen falls below the 99% to 100% levels historically achieved, as we expect it might in the near term. To Slide 4, where we take a step back for a moment to outline some of the unique aspects of our business that may not always be fully appreciated, but which we believe are important components of the partnership as a good long term investment.
We're a market leader in the operation of shuttle tankers with more than 30 continuous years of experience and investment in this business. Something that is important for many of our US unit holders is that canopy is classified as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we issue Form 1099 to report our distributions and not Form K1.
