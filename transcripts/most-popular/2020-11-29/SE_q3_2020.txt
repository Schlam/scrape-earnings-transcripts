Good morning. Welcome to Sea Limited Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Minju Song. Please go ahead.
Minju Song
Thank you, Kate. Good evening and good morning, everyone and welcome to Sea’s 2020 third quarter earnings conference call. I am Minju Song from Sea’s Group Chief Corporate Officer’s Office.
Before we continue, I would like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that may not be realized in the future for various reasons as stated in our press release. Also, this call includes discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and net loss, excluding share-based compensation and changes in fair value of the 2017 convertible notes. We believe these measures can enhance our investors’ understanding of the actual cash flows of our major businesses when used as a complement to our GAAP disclosure. For a discussion of the use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation with the posted GAAP measures, please refer to the section on non-GAAP financial measures in our press release.
I have here with Sea’s Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer, Forrest Li; Group Chief Financial Officer, Tony Hou; and Group Chief Corporate Officer, Yanjun Wang. Our management will share strategy and business updates, operating highlights and financial performance for the quarter. This will be followed by a Q&A session in which we welcome any questions you have.
With that, let me turn the call over to Forrest.
Forrest Li
Hello, everyone and thank you as always for joining today’s call. We are very happy to report another quarter of strong performance across our business. We continued to see robust user growth and deepening of user engagement on each of our platforms during the quarter. We believe accelerating shift to digitalization in our global market is the sustaining trend. As the market leader in our core segments, we are well positioned to capture the growth opportunities presented by this acceleration. Our strong financial and operational results for the quarter once again underline our ability to execute well and see a disproportionate share of the faster-growing markets.
On the group level, our quarterly GAAP revenue grew 99% year-on-year to reach $1.2 billion. Gross profit grew 101% year-on-year to reach $407.6 million. We also recorded very strong bottom line results, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $120.4 million. This further demonstrates the strength and efficiency of our business model. We will continue to drive rapid growth with efficiency as we further extend our market leadership. In line with our strong results, we are raising our guidance for both digital entertainment and e-commerce for the full year of 2020. In digital entertainment, we believe our very strong performance in the third quarter will sustain through the fourth quarter. As a result, we now expect bookings for digital entertainment to exceed $3.1 billion, representing over 75% growth from 2019. This revised guidance represents an increase of more than 59% from the midpoint of the previously disclosed guidance.
