Ryan Weispfenning
Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Video Webcast. I am Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. Before we start the prepared remarks, I am going to share with you a few details to keep in mind about today's webcast.
Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 30, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from the sell side analysts that cover the company. Today's events should last about an hour.
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a divisional and geographic revenue summary. We also posted an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance which can be accessed from our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.
During today's webcast, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and are given on an organic basis which adjust for foreign currency. There were no acquisitions made in the last year that had a significant impact on our quarterly revenue growth. All references to share gains or losses are on a calendar quarter basis unless otherwise stated.
Finally, reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com.
And with that, let's get started.
Geoffrey Martha
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our Q2 results were significantly stronger than Q1 and came in well ahead of our expectations. Our recovery from the depths of the pandemic has been faster than expected and we are now approaching year-over-year growth. Now while we continue to monitor COVID resurgence around the globe, healthcare systems are by and large better prepared and patients are more willing to seek the care they need.
Obviously, there's some near-term uncertainty, but I am encouraged by the steps we have taken over the past year to position Medtronic, not only for continued recovery, but to maximize our performance over the medium and long-term. Now building on the strength of our pipeline, we're going on the offensive and winning share in several of our businesses. We're investing in opportunities to create and disrupt big markets and we're seeing the results.
