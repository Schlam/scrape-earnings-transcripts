Thank you, Christy. Again, our sincere apologies to all those on the telephone, we have had technical difficulties here with our webcast portion of this conference call, although the telephonic portion is working just fine. So again, we do apologize. We appreciate your patience and your interest in H&P. In order to cure the problem, we will be posting the audio recording from this conference call within 2 hours from the conclusion. We will be restarting from the top. We apologize again. We will conduct a full 1-hour conference call. We hope you are available to stick with us and join us as we give you our fourth quarter fiscal ‘20 results and look ahead to fiscal 2021.
I would like to turn the call over now to our Investor Relations Director, Mr. David Wilson. Dave?
David Wilson
Alright. Thank, Mark. And I would like to re-welcome everybody to Helmerich & Payne’s conference call for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2020. With us today are John Lindsay, President and CEO; Mark Smith, Senior Vice President and CFO. Both John and Mark will be sharing some prepared comments with us, after which we will open the call for questions.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based upon current information and management’s expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such, our outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings. You should place no undue reliance on forward-looking statements and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements. We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You will find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations in yesterday’s press release.
With that said, I will turn the call over to John Lindsay.
John Lindsay
Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. This is yet another example that this fourth fiscal quarter is unprecedented in many ways and really challenging during the company’s 100-year history. The destruction of oil demand induced by COVID is well documented. And in terms of drilling activity, our rig count hit bottom in August.
Despite the challenging quarter, our strong financial position has enabled us to remain focused on our long-term strategies. Our people are developing new commercial models and innovative drilling and digital technologies that we believe will help transform the customer experience and shape the future of this business. These efforts have progressed despite this difficult environment and will serve as the foundation from which the company will build as the market continues to recover. Our customer-centric approach is one that prioritizes providing customized solutions by employing a combination of people, processes, rigs and automation technology to deliver more value and lower risk for our customers. This approach is distinctive in the industry, it resonates well across our customer base and with further developments on the horizon will be a major driver of growth as activity levels improve.
