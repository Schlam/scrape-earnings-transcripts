Jed Latkin
Thank you, Scott. This call -- first off, I just want to say that this call is being webcast live on our website ir.navidea.com and a replay will be made available. Following prepared remarks, we're just going to do a Q&A as well as always.
During the course of the conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company. These events relate to our business plans to develop Navidea's molecular diagnostics and immunotherapeutics, which include clinical and regulatory developments and timing of clinical data readouts along with capital resources and strategic matters, as well as the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on Navidea's business operations.
All of these statements are based on the beliefs and expectations of management as of today. These statements involve certain assumptions of risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Investors should read carefully the risks and uncertainties described within the Safe Harbor section of our website as well as the risk factors included in the company's most recently quarterly and annual filing with the SEC.
I want to thank everyone for calling in today for today's third quarter conference call. The last several months for this company have been quite busy and I'll provide a brief recap, before I turn the call over to Dr. Rosol to go through the exciting news of our deeper dive into the arm three data now that we have more than half the patient at completion of week 24.
As all of you on the will call know, we engaged in several transformational transactions this past quarter. We signed a binding MoU with Jubilant that when completed will provide up to $20 million upfront capital as well as several hundred million in sales milestones along with significant double-digit royalties in the future.
The MoU contain an exclusive negotiation period and we are currently in the middle of that period now. We have ongoing due diligence in commercial, clinical, legal, and financial all of which are moving along very nicely. Jubilant has been quite thorough and as a result of that, we are generating some excellent data that has validated our commercial assumptions and has given us a much deeper look into the data that we are generating. Dr. Rosol will spend quite a bit of time this evening presenting the data which we are very, very excited about.
Another area of great change in the company is some degree of financial flexibility after years of penury. You will notice when you see our Q that financial language has changed significantly. Despite all the turbulence in the markets and the uncertainty surrounding COVID, even if we don't complete the Jubilant transaction, we are fully funded to complete our Phase 3 trials and bring our product to market without further dilution.
We are working hard on all the little things that investors don't talk about supply chain, product sourcing, delivery efficiency, and everything that will make this company quite successful for the long haul. These upcoming months will not be easy, as we will be quite busy finalizing the licensing and distribution agreement with Jubilant which you blend moving forward with the FDA meetings and getting everything else aligned as we prepare to launch the Phase 3.
