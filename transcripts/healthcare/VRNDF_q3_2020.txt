Thank you, Alexa, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for Delta 9's Q3 2020 earnings call. With me this morning is the company's Chief Financial Officer, Jim Lawson; and our VP of Corporate Affairs, Ian Chadsey. Our earnings press release, Q3 2020 financial statements, and Management Discussion and Analysis have now been made available on SEDAR and our company website.
And with that, let's begin. As we all know, the Canadian cannabis industry has encountered growing pains and challenges over the past several quarters in Canada's initial rollout of a legalized recreational use market. Over the past 12 months, cannabis sector participants have experienced headwinds relating to missed revenue and earnings expectations, delays in retail store rollouts, bottlenecks at provincial crown distributors and a general oversupply situation, which has worsened into 2020. More recently, the global escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty for businesses across all sectors and volatility in global capital markets.
To date Delta 9 has been fortunate to have weathered this crisis better than many companies. We are pleased today to be presenting you Delta 9’s Q3 2020 financial and operating results. These results demonstrated significant year-over-year improvement for Delta 9. We have many positive takeaways from today's results, which we’ll highlight as well as analyzing our misses, the challenges we have encountered and the changes we're making to continue to drive growth and create shareholder value.
We'll begin with a discussion of operations and material milestones for the company achieved over the reporting period. But firstly, an overview of the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations. On March 30th, we announced publicly that we had implemented numerous precautionary health and safety measures across our operations to protect customers and employees while maintaining operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's management have been actively implementing measures to protect staff and stakeholders from exposure to COVID-19. These measures include moving many head office functions to work-from-home, or unstaggered head office shifts, implementing flexible sick time, increasing sanitation procedures in retail stores and production facilities, encouraging proper hygiene and hand washing for staff members, providing PPE for both staff, and in our retail stores and production facilities, enforcing physical distancing practices between our staff and/or customers and more. We continue to update these policies and procedures at the recommendation of our health professionals.
