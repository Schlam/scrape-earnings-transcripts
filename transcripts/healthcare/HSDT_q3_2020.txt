Great. Thank you, operator, and hello and welcome to everyone to Helius Medical's third quarter of 2020 earnings conference call. I'm joined on the call this evening by Joyce LaViscount, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Leno, our Vice President and General Manager of our Canadian Operations.
Let me provide you with a quick agenda of what we're going to focus on today as part of our strategy to reposition the company, to create intermediate and long-term shareholder value. First as the recently appointed President and CEO of Helius, I'll begin my remarks with a brief introduction. I'll then discuss our U.S. regulatory strategy and progress we have made in recent months. Following this discussion, I'll hand it off to Mark, who will provide you with an update on our commercial activities in Canada. Joyce will then briefly review our third quarter financial results, as well as the recent progress we have made to secure additional capital and enhance our balance sheet condition. Following Joyce's remarks, I'll conclude with some thoughts on our near term and longer term outlook before we open the call for questions.
Before delving in to the update for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to just introduce myself, provide a few summary points on my background and share where I focused my time since joining the executive leadership team. I joined Helius Medical with over 30 years of experience in the financial industry. The majority of my career has been with Maple Leaf Partners, a hedge fund, a value-based hedge fund that I founded in 1996 and subsequently grew to over $2 billion in assets under management. I also held Board of Director positions for multiple companies in the medical device and Medtech sub-sector including here at Helius Medical.
Three years ago, I joined the Board of Directors at Helius after conducting my diligence because I was fascinated by the PoNS technology and the opportunities in store for this organization. With its potential to improve the lives of patients with chronic neurological conditions by empowering the natural healing processes of the brain, I believe the PoNS device and treatment and ultimately Helius is uniquely positioned to address one of the last frontiers in health.
