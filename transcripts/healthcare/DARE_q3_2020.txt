Sabrina Martucci Johnson
Thank you, and welcome to our financial results and business update call for Daré Bioscience. We are looking forward to discussion our third quarter results reflecting on some important achievements to date in 2020 highlighting anticipated developments and milestones for the remainder of 2020 and providing some perspective regarding our plans for 2021.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical facts should be considered forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by these statements due to unknown and known risks and uncertainties and so therefore you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in the company's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed on March 27, 2020 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 which was filed today.
I'd also like to point out that the content of this call includes time-sensitive information that is current only as of today, November 12, 2020. Daré takes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or developments after this call, except as required by law.
Now as you know, Daré is a leader in women's health innovation and we're squarely focused on improving the life and wellbeing of women. Our value creation strategy is to accelerate availability of new prescription products for women by selecting and advancing product candidates that we believe have the potential to be first in category and first line and have meaningful commercial opportunity with four clinical stage programs in vaginal health, contraception and menopause.
As we approach the end of 2020, we are particularly looking forward to our Phase 3 top line data readout for our DARE-BV1 program this year. DARE-BV1 is our potential new first line option for bacterial vaginosis, a serious condition that is estimated to affect approximately 21 million women in the U.S. alone. Many of the existing therapies are considered to be [Indiscernible] and DARE-BV1 has the potential to deliver a meaningful improvement in the clinical care rate over the current FDA approved products.
We are excited to report that involvement in the Phase 3 study was completed last month and all subjects have also completed their last visit. We therefore expect to announce top line data before the end of this year.
During today’s call we will provide additional context on the upcoming DARE-BV1 Phase 3 read out as well as next steps towards regulatory submission and the partnering strategy to support eventual market introduction and commercialization. We will also provide updates on activities to support on-going development of our novel contraceptive candidate Ovaprene and investigational hormone free monthly vaginal contraceptive under a license agreement with Bayer a world leader in the branded contraceptive market. And we’ll discuss activities we plan to commence in 2021, including the Phase 2b for a potential first-in-category Sildenafil Cream program, which is the only program to our knowledge being developed to address female sexual arousal disorder or FSAD, the most analogous to the female sexual dysfunction disorders to erectile dysfunction in men.
