Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss BIOLASE's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. On the call today from BIOLASE are Todd Norbe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Beaver, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. Management will review the company's operating performance on the third quarter before opening the call for questions.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that a number of forward-looking statements, which are any statements that are not historical facts, will be made during this presentation, including forward-looking statements regarding the company's strategic initiatives and financial performance.
These forward-looking statements are based on BIOLASE's current expectations and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation. Such forward-looking statements only represent the company's view as of today, November 12, 2020. These risks are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A replay of this conference call will be available on the BIOLASE website shortly after the completion of today's call. When listening to the presentation, please refer to the news release issued earlier today announcing the company's 2020 third quarter results. If you do not have a copy of the news release, it is available in the Investor Relations section of the BIOLASE website at www.biolase.com.
BIOLASE's financial results can also be found in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC. The tables we've provided in today's news release offer additional financial information, so we encourage you to review them. The tables include a reconciliation of unaudited GAAP net loss and net loss per share to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss and adjusted EBITDA loss per share, as well as the details of the company's non-GAAP disclosures.
With that said, Iâ€™ll now turn the call over to BIOLASE's President and Chief Executive Officer, Todd Norbe. Todd?
Todd Norbe
Thanks Todd and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your interest and continued support of BIOLASE. Let me start with an update on our operations and the status of dental offices as it relates to COVID-19 pandemic. As we have stressed throughout this pandemic, our foremost concern continues to be the health and safety of the BIOLASE community, including our employees, customers, their patients and our partners. We continue to take every precaution to ensure their well-being during this time.
Over 95% of dental offices across the country are now reopened. And dental procedure levels are currently at 70% to 80% of their pre-COVID-19 levels. So, a marked improvement compared to when we last spoke in August following our Q2 results. We want to applaud dentists throughout the country as they respond to the pandemic with a sense of urgency, implementing the recommended Center for Disease Control and American Dental Association guidelines, ensuring that they can take care of the patients in a very safe environment.
