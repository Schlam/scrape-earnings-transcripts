Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong third quarter across multiple measures of success. Our revenue and volumes increased significantly over the prior quarter, rebounding to pre-pandemic levels in September ahead of our projected timing.
We believe Aspira Women's Health is effectively weathering the storm of the pandemic and building on the momentum. We have delivered solid test volume recovery, improved price sequentially, added to our covered lives, and lastly made significant additions to our board, medical and executive team.
We continue to advance our product pipeline and strengthen our financial position in 2020. We have also launched a digital and media campaign to strengthen our brand identity, as well as increased awareness of our test and its advantages of early detection of risk and racial disparity compared to CA125. We also recently received coverage from two investment bank analysts. We are very proud of this progress, and we'll expand upon each of these in turn.
Starting with our team, we have made efforts to bring on a prestigious appointment to our board, and recently announced the appointment to our board, Dr. Sandra Brooks, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Given Dr. Brooks longstanding research interest in health equity, she will be an invaluable resource in advising the company on driving awareness of racial and health disparities, as well as to drive overall adoption of the OVA suite of products into the care pathway.
I would also note this appointment brings our board to majority female status, which we feel as important as a woman's health company. We have several additional announcements, we are adding Dr. Elena Ratner, Co-Chief of Gynecologic Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine as our Chief Medical Advisor. She is also serving as the Co-Director of the ovarian cancer early detection program for women. That is part of discovery to cure. Yale medicines initiative focused on combating all reproductive cancers.
