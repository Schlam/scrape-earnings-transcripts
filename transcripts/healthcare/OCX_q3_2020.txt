Ronnie Andrews
Hey, thanks Bob, and welcome everyone to our conference call to discuss our third quarter 2020 financial results and operating highlights. Joining me today are Mitch Levine, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Doug Ross, our Chief Medical Officer; and Padma Sundar, our Senior Vice President of Commercial. We'll all be available at the end of our -- of the end of our prepared remarks for a question-and-answer session.
We've made great strides in advancing our mission in the third quarter, having made the leap to becoming a commercial diagnostics company, generating revenue, while also laying a strong foundation with multiple growth engines that together support our near-term objectives and the company's long-term growth trajectory. We have a lot to share today. So we appreciate your patience today as I walk you through our strategy and share milestones and highlights of our tangible progress with each of our growth initiatives, which we believe position OncoCyte as a leader in oncology diagnostics with an immediate focus in lung cancer and immunotherapy diagnostics.
Over the last 15 months, we've successfully transformed the company and established four solid growth engines that each independently have the potential to drive the enterprise value beyond its current level. And when combined, create a dynamic value multiplier in large market opportunities. The market forces are in place to move immune and targeted therapies to early stage diagnosis from their current use as a late stage salvage approach.
Our vision is to facilitate the path for pharmaceutical companies to transition their drugs to early stage utility first for lung cancer, followed by triple negative breast cancer and ultimately to become the immune therapy diagnostic company across all solid tumors and across all stages of cancer. While that may sound like a bold vision, the reality is that in the last five quarters, since I started as a CEO, we've acquired our license the majority of the components we need to execute on this mission, which we fully expect will build significant enterprise value for our shareholders.
