Good afternoon, everyone. A little breaking news to start the call today; early today, for the second year in a row, Black Book Market Research has awarded CynergisTek as the top Cybersecurity Consultants for assessment audit, strategy and implementation in the healthcare industry. This is an award well, we're really proud of. As an independent survey from 705 healthcare providers, we don't pay for placement, and frankly did not even know it was coming until we saw the press release this morning. And 2020 has been a bit of a crazy year for everyone. But to get this type of recognition from the industry and from our clients, further demonstrates that our strategy is working.
We've worked aggressively to add new capabilities to deal with a changing threat landscape, including compromise assessment, security validation, and we've been on the front lines helping clients address these recent ransomware attacks. With all of that it's a real honor to continue to get recognized by our clients in the industry in a really tough year like this. Beating out to major players including Clearwater, Booz Allen, KPMG UI, IBM fortifies a host of others. So I wanted to make sure I mentioned this before we get into the details of the quarter.
Now, towards the end of Q3 and into the beginning of the fourth quarter, we started to see signs of market recovery. This has shown itself in a number of ways. First, we're seeing clients, particularly those that have a more mature security posture, realizing that the pandemic, the move to work from home, the rapid deployment of telemedicine and new expectations for interoperability have created new vulnerabilities in their security posture. Concluding these trends are not temporary, has created an increased willingness to enter into long term contracts with a focus on shoring up your defenses in this new world. This was highlighted in our two recent releases with Valley Health and Fairview Health, both new logos to the CynergisTek family. These customers were interested in the combination of our core managed services, along with our strategy to go beyond just security assessments and into the validation of security controls. We also saw some recent renewals with long standing customers that included the addition of some of these new services, increasing their commitment to security.
Second, we saw progress in our efforts to diversify beyond our base, which is primarily made up of healthcare providers and into the broader industry of healthcare. A good example of this is the recent managed services signing with a large state Department of Public Health in the West Coast. Now as you can imagine, health departments across the US are front and center in the effort to track infections and manage contact traces. As such, they're generating volumes of information and must be properly assessed, protected and secured. All in healthcare all organization and our consultants are ideally suited for this mission. I also want to mention our recent traction with [Red Skin], a CynergisTek own brand that focuses on offensive security testing outside of our traditional healthcare market. One of our strategic imperatives last year was to rebuilding upscaler penetration testing team, is now our offensive security team has new people and when we do offerings, which has allowed us to win consulting contracts in one of the nation's largest media companies, and a well known consumer electronics company, Logitech.
