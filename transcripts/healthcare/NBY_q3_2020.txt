Thank you, Jody. And thank you everybody for joining us today. This is an exceptionally exciting time at NovaBay. We’re reporting record quarterly earnings, or I'm sorry, record quarterly unit sales and are finalizing the launch preparations for our groundbreaking product CelleRx Clinical Reset. With this launch, we’ll be creating a new opportunity for the company to expand by entering the beauty market.
I'm pleased to begin this call by discussing the successful execution on our strategy to expand our product portfolio to support growth under economic terms that makes sense to NovaBay. Following an extensive evaluation of product and market opportunities that capitalize on our hypochlorous acid technology, we developed CelleRx Clinical Reset. Clinical Reset is a differentiated product in the beauty category and like Avenova it is formulated with our patented pure hypochlorous acid, which unlike many of our competitors is manufactured here in the United States.
It's exciting to introduce a novel consumer use for our unique hypochlorous acid. Clinical Reset is a gentle, calming and soothing facial spray that disrupts the layer of bacteria that settles and grows on the face. It keeps the skin narrow
because when this barrier is out of balance, acne, rosacea and infection can set in. As the brand name suggests, Clinical Reset gets the skin back to a healthy baseline to heal itself into better absorbed skincare products.
The use of Clinical Reset can replace or augment a morning cleanse for dry sensitive skin, reduce bacteria after exercising, calm skin following microdermabrasion and other aesthetic facial procedures and combat environmental aggressors. During the pandemic, we have all learned the importance of personal healthcare, and that skincare is a part of that routine.
