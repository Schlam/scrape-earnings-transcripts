Thank you, Miri. And thanks to all of you for joining our third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. In this earning call, we will discuss our third quarter financial results in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, our strategy during the crisis and our outlook of going forward. We are an international company. With me on the line today, Yair Malca, our CFO from California; Shakil Lakhani, our President of North America in Houston; Dr. Michael Kreindel, our CTO and Co-Founder in Toronto; and Dr. Spero Theodorou, our Chief Medical Officer from New York.
In the third quarter of 2020, InMode generated record revenue of $59.7 million, a 49% increase from third quarter of 2019, a record of $23.9 million of net income on a GAAP basis and $26.6 million of net income on a non-GAAP basis. In Q3 2020, we derived approximately 58% of our worldwide revenue from our surgical platforms engaged in minimally invasive and subdermal ablative treatment, 35% from our recently introduced proprietary hands-free platforms and 7% from our traditional laser and non-invasive RF platforms.
The record revenue in the third quarter was driven by demand for our minimally invasive and hands-free proprietary electrosurgical bipolar RF platforms, which are becoming the standard of care for variety of surgical procedures. We have proven our organization adaptability and innovative leadership during the quarter as we successfully accelerate demand for our differentiated product in the US once COVID-19 restriction eased. Internationally, we grew our sales rapidly, more than doubling the revenue on year-over-year basis. This growth was driven by our marketing and sales activity in China, Brazil, Mexico, Korea and through our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.
