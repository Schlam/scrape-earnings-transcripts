Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon or good morning. My name is Julia Neugebauer, Director of Investor Relations at MorphoSys, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2020 financial results and operational update conference call.
Joining me on the call today are Jean-Paul Kress, CEO; Jens Holstein, CFO; Malte Peters, Chief Research and Development Officer; and Roland Wandeler, Chief Operating Officer. A press release was issued yesterday with our third quarter 2020 financial results and business update. This can be found on our website along with the presentation for today's webcast.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you on Slide 2, that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of our products and our development plans, the impact of COVID-19 on our business and expectations for the compounds in our pipeline as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners.
These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in MorphoSys 20-F and annual report or for the year ended December 31, 2019, and from time-to-time in other SEC documents of MorphoSys. It is important to keep in mind that our statements on this webcast speak as of today.
On Slide 3, you will find the agenda for today's call. Jean-Paul will begin with an overview of corporate highlights from the third quarter followed by Roland, who will provide a commercial update. Then Malte will discuss our R&D activities before turning the call to Jens for summary of our third quarter and nine months financial results. Following these prepared remarks, we'll open the call for your questions.
With that, I will now hand the call over to Jean-Paul.
Jean-Paul Kress
Thank you, Julia. Good day everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss the considerable progress we have made over the past month, as we transition to commercial company with sizable clinical development pipeline and multiple partnerships worldwide.
In the third quarter of 2020, we achieved great progress in all operational areas, ranging from commercial to clinical development to research. The approval of Monjuvi, marked MorphoSys transformation into a fully integrated biopharma company aiming to master every step of the value chain. I am also very excited about two deals that will enhance our clinical development and our research capabilities. Our agreement with Xencor adds to our tafasitamab backbone strategy. While the in-licensing of an innovative technology from Cherry Biolabs complements our research portfolio.
Moving to Slide 6. The third quarter of 2020 was highlighted by the FDA accelerated approval of Monjuvi. As a treatment for non-transplant eligible relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL which represents the FDAs first approval for the second line treatment in this indication. Since approval, our teams have been laser focused to bring Monjuvi to patients suffering with this deadly cancer, who have limited treatment options.
