Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Ra Medical Systems Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded November 12, 2020. [Operator Instructions].

This is Jody Cain with LHA. Thank you for participating in today's call. Joining me from Ra Medical are Will McGuire, Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier today, Ra Medical issued a news release announcing financial results for the second quarter of 2020. If you've not received this news release or you'd like to be added to the company's e-mail distribution list, please contact LHA in New York at 212-838-3777 and speak with Carolyn Curran. You can also sign up for e-mail alerts and access the news release in the Investor Relations section of the Ra Medical website at ir.ramed.com.
During this call, management will be making a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. To the extent the statements made by management are not descriptions of historical facts regarding Ra Medical, these are forward-looking statements reflecting the beliefs and expectations of management as of November 12, 2020. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond the company's control and could materially affect actual results. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on Ra Medical's operations, financial results and outlook is the best estimate based on information for today's discussion.
For details about these risks, please see the earnings release that accompanies this call and the company's SEC filings, including Ra Medical's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2020, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020, to be filed with the SEC. Ra Medical expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Today's conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Ra Medical believes the non-GAAP financial results provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods for certain items that may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating the business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found at the end of the financial results news release that was issued earlier today.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Will McGuire. Will?
Will McGuire
Thanks Jody good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share our progress and provide an update on our business. Before discussing our engineering and clinical efforts I'd like to talk about our quality initiatives and improvements. In the past 12 months we've made key senior hires and added resources to the quality department and I think the results are showing with a more robust and effective quality system. As an example following an internal audit late last year our quality group initiated a quality improvement plan comprised of 116 items that needed addressing within the quality management system with a focus on standard operating procedures, preventive maintenance, equipment status and calibrations and supplier quality among others.
