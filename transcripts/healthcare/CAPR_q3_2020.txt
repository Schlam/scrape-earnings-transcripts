Greetings, and welcome to the Capricor Therapeutics Inc Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now pleasure to introduce your host, CFO, A.J. Bergmann. Thank you, you may begin.
A.J. Bergmann
Thank you. Before we start, I would like to state that we will be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation. These statements may include statements regarding, among other things, the efficacy, safety and intended utilization of our product candidates, our future Research & Development plan, including our anticipated conduct and timing of preclinical and clinical studies, our plans to present or report additional data, our plans regarding regulatory filings, potential regulatory developments involving our product candidates and our possible uses of existing cash and investment resources. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
These and other risks are described in our periodic filings made with the SEC, including our quarterly and annual reports. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update such statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda Marbán, CEO.
Linda Marbán
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call and corporate update. I'll begin my remarks with updates on our rapidly advancing engineered Exosomes platform which include our mRNA and VLP vaccine candidate. I'll then update you on CAP-1002, our self-therapy product for the treatment of patients later stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and patients with COVID-19.
Now let's about the next chapter for Capricor. This has been an exciting week for all of us with the announcement on Monday by Pfizer of a potentially effective vaccine for COVID-19. Most importantly, it is likely that humanity will benefit. But is also of great importance to Capricor and our Exosomes platform for drug delivery that we're building. Pfizer's vaccine is an mRNA vaccine and demonstration of its effectiveness could change vaccinology and in fact even therapeutics permanently.
We have anticipated this outcome and believe that the best delivery partner for mRNA is an engineered Exosomes. And that is exactly what we've been working for the better part of 2020. We are now ready to develop RNAs for therapeutic delivery and are excited to be part of this new wave of opportunities in biotechnology. The success of the vaccine candidate is validating for our platform and paves the way for our potential Gen-2 [ph] vaccines that could confirm greater cellular immunity as well as generate antibodies.
Our vaccine candidates express more viral proteins to elicit potentially broader coverage. More importantly, the recent success of an mRNA vaccine candidate presents many important opportunities for Capricor as we build our RNA Exosomes s delivery platform which includes an expanded focus of engineered Exosomes s to treat or prevent a variety of different diseases and disorders.
We've been working on Exosomes s for the last two years and realized they could potentially revolutionize biotechnology very much like antibody therapy did over two decades ago. Now earlier this week, we announced the publication of what we considered to be our most important publication since our founding. We've found that Exosomes made from a standard commercially available cell line and loaded with mRNA for four viral proteins and is a long lasting cellular and humoral immunity in mice potentially setting a stage for clinical trials.
