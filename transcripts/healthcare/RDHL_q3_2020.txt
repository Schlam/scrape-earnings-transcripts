Thank you, Alexandra. Good day, everyone and thank you for joining us. We'll be presenting select business highlights today. So, please remember to press on the link to the slide deck that we'll be presenting later on.
Thanks to the strength of the RedHill organization, and its relentless focus on execution, we experienced significant and rapid progress in the third quarter despite the challenging pandemic environment and the disruption it created.
I would like to thank the RedHill team for their dedication, resilience, and that continued the impressive growth during the last quarter. Specifically, our extensive promotional efforts for Talicia delivered 300% quarter-over-quarter prescription growth as well as rapid expansion of the prescriber base supported by an existing national payer coverage for 167 million Americans, which continues to grow.
Movantik prescriptions grew for a second consecutive quarter, just reversing the trend of prescription decline prior to its acquisition RedHill. The global Phase 2/3 and the U.S. Phase 2 studies with opaganib for COVID-19 are quickly approaching completion and we have generated important data demonstrating opaganib complete integration of SARS-CoV-2 application.
