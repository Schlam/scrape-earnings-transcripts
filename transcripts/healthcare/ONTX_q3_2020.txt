Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Onconova's third quarter 2020 financial results and business update conference call. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release outlining our financial results and business progress during the quarter. If you have not yet seen this press release it is available on the Investor & Media page of our website, at www.onconova.com.
On today's call, Dr. Steve Fruchtman, President and CEO, will discuss the company's recent highlights and anticipated clinical and business milestones. And then Mark Guerin, our Chief Financial Officer, will review third quarter financial results. Following Mark's report, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call and will be joined by Dr. Ric Woodman our Chief Medical Officer.

Thank you, Avi. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon. We hope you and your loved ones are safe and remain healthy. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly impacted us all and how we leave and work together. At Onconova, we are still awaiting word on our funding requests to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Branch of the National Institutes of Health and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority also known as BARDA.
The possible funding of clinical trials with rigosertib in patients with COVID-19 disease. However, Cancer, and the development of effective new anti-cancer therapies remains a significant health issue and is our corporate focus. We believe Onconova is well positioned to play an important role in developing differentiated therapeutics for cancer care.
During the third quarter, our product pipeline advanced nicely with ON 123300 entering the clinic in a Phase 1 study in China and oral rigosertib entering a Phase 1 investigator initiated study in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor Nivolumab in K-RAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer.
