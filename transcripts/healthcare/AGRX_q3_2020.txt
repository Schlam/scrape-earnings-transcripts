Good afternoon, and welcome everyone for our third quarter 2020 conference call. We're pleased to report that we remain on track to launch Twirla, our first FDA approved product, which is a once a week hormonal contraceptive patch. During the third quarter of 2020, we delivered on several key stated objectives. According to our plan timeline, that brings us closer to this exciting moment in Agile's history. We trained and deployed our Salesforce, executed on our manufacturing plan and progressed on our managed care opportunities, all by controlling our spending prudently.
We've said all along that the launch of Twirla would happen in the fourth quarter of 2020. And today, we're excited to report that we remain on track. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our talented leadership team and partners. We expect to launch Twirla by the end of this year. We look forward to this important milestone and to providing women with a new contraceptive choice that fits their lifestyles. For a whole team achieving this launch of Twirla while working from home since March will be a remarkable accomplishment that cannot be understated.
Now on to an overview of the third quarter in greater detail, starting with manufacturing. After completing production of the pre-validation batch of Twirla, we initiated and remain on track to finalize the three validation batches that we expect will produce product to support our commercial launch. All three of these badges are expected to be released for commercial use by the end of this year. We are pleased with the progress we've made on the manufacturing front and appreciate the continued support of our partner Corium.
