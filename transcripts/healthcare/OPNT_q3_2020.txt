Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to share today’s results that reflect the progress of our lead program in opioid overdose and the overall essential value proposition of our mission to treat addiction and overdose, as well as our strong cash position. 
I will begin with an update on our lead development program, then, our CFO, David O'Toole will review our financials. With a focus on strong execution, we have achieved important progress in further advancing our lead development program, OPNT003 nasal nalmefene opioid overdose. 
As announced recently, we will use Aptar Pharma’s Unit Dose Nasal Spray device or OPNT003. This nasal spray device has already been approved by the FDA with many other drug products currently marketed in the United States including NARCAN Nasal Spray. 
Developing nalmefene nasal spray using the Aptar unit dose device aligns with the FDA’s focus on proven device safety and help mitigate device-related risks to the program. They’ve also made recent advancements with our U.S.-based development and manufacturing partner, Summit Biosciences to manufacture our nalmefene nasal spray. 
Importantly, the Summit facility has successfully passed FDA inspection and has commercial capacity. Summit is on track with the production of the clinical and registration patches. I think for the momentum, we will meet with the FDA in December to review the protocol of our planned Pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers, as well as our overall data generation and 505(b)(2) submission strategy.
