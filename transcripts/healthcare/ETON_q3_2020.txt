Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Eton's third quarter 2020 conference call. This afternoon, we issued a press release that outlines the topics we plan to discuss on today's call. The release is available on our website, etonpharma.com. Joining me on the call today, we have Sean Brynjelsen, our CEO; Wilson Troutman, our CFO and Paul Stickler, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call may contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, from those contained in these forward-looking statements. Please see the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our earnings release and the risk factors in the Company's filings with the SEC.

Thank you, David. Thank you everyone for joining us today. I am excited to share with you the many milestones that we've achieved since our last earnings call, including two FDA approvals, multiple NDA submissions and a successful equity financing. This accomplishment set us up for a strong finish to 2020 and positioned Eton for a transformational year in 2021, as we launch our portfolio of products. One of the most significant events this quarter was the approval of Alkindi Sprinkle, for the treatment of adrenal cortical insufficiency in patients under 17 years of age. We are extremely excited about Alkindi's commercial prospects, and we have assembled a highly experienced commercial team to lead the launch. I will be discussing our Alkindi launch plans in more detail later in the call.
We were also pleased to see the approval of Alaway Preservative Free during the quarter. This product is the first preservative-free OTC ophthalmic product approved for the treatment of itchy eyes, caused by allergic conjunctivitis. Bausch Healthcare plans to make the product available by the spring allergy season and Eton will receive a milestone payment upon commercial launch, as well as an ongoing royalty on sales of the product. During the quarter, we also made significant progress with our pipeline. Our announcement today that Ephedrine Injection has been accepted for filing by the FDA, means that now all nine of our product pipeline candidates have been either submitted to the FDA or approved, that would be six submissions pending, three already approved. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our team and a major milestone for the Company. I believe it's unprecedented to see a Company of our age, a little over three years, with this many NDA submissions.
In recent weeks, we've also successfully closed an oversubscribed equity financing that provided us with gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million. This transaction solidified our strong financial position and we still have an available $8 million, undrawn on our credit facility with SWK Holdings. We are confident that our current financial position will be sufficient to take us to profitability, which we expect to reach by the end of 2021. Biorphen sales in the quarter continued to be impacted by COVID-19-related hospital restrictions and practitioners' aversion to the ampule format. However, we remain committed to the product and are on track to submit the vial prior approval supplement by the end of this year. This would allow us to launch the vial in the first half of 2021. In preparation for the launch of the Biorphen vial next year, we've lowered the price of our ampule product in the third quarter. This resulted in a one-time revenue adjustment, due to a shelf stock adjustment charge to account for inventory, that was on hand with wholesalers at the time of the price change. We remain very optimistic that the vial launch will accelerate adoption of our Biorphen to be a meaningful revenue generator in 2021.
