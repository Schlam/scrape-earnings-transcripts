Thank you, Bob, and thank you, everyone for joining our call today. I hope you and your families remain healthy and safe. I will begin by providing a business update and discuss Motus GI's performance in the third quarter. I will then turn the call over to Andrew who will review our financial results. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions.
I'd like to start by discussing the current environment we are seeing in U.S. hospitals, specifically as it relates to inpatient colonoscopy procedure volume, sales rep and clinical support access to hospitals and procedures, physician mindshare, as relates to evaluating a new technology like the Pure-Vu system, and value analysis committee or VAC timelines.
It goes without saying that the COVID-19 pandemic created significant challenges for U.S. hospitals. During the second quarter, the New York society for GI endoscopy, published reports showing endoscopy volumes had declined by 57% to 96%. This massive reduction in endoscopy procedures significantly hindered our commercial introduction of Pure-Vu in the first-half of 2020.
With that said, I'm pleased to report that we saw a positive turn in our commercial progress towards the end of Q3. In speaking to our GI customers, we saw inpatient colonoscopy volumes ramp up to approximately 80% to 90% of pre-pandemic levels, and we are resuming the trajectory we started in Q1 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As procedure volumes started to return to more normal levels, in August and September, we began to see a positive turn in our results, in terms of Pure-Vu utilization. We now have on-site sales rep and clinical support access at about 80% of our accounts. All of our accounts have implemented stricter controls. But gaining on-site access is critical when launching a new product, particularly as it relates to conducting efficient, successful evaluations. While the remote access support tools we have developed have been very useful, we believe in person sales and support is simply more effective with the new product launch.
