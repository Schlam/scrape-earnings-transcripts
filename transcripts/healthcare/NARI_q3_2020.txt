Thank you, Caroline. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We have enjoyed a busy and highly productive Q3, which we will review in a moment. 
But I'd like to start first with a story that might help remind you of who we are and what we do. Last quarter, I shared with you a story about a patient with a massive pulmonary embolism, who was in such poor condition that his wife was summoned to the cath lab to say goodbye. Moments later, the physician used our FlowTriever technology to extract several large blood clots from the patient's pulmonary arteries, leading to immediate improvement of symptoms and vital signs while the patient was still on the table, followed by a remarkable and rapid recovery. 
I'd like to share now with you a very different story about a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, patient with a guarded prognosis due to his underlying cancer. This patient, in fact, has terminal metastatic prostate cancer. Patient presented multiple times to the hospital for various cancer-related procedures, drug infusions and follow ups. He complained of heaviness, pain and swelling of his legs, worsening with each visit, further and further [Technical Difficulty] formerly highly active man's ability to even walk.
