Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on today's call, and I hope all of you as well as your loved ones and colleagues are safe and in good health. Clearly, the COVID-19 pandemics has been challenging for all of us on both personnel and professional levels throughout 2020. Like many in our industry, our progress at Aptinyx was affected. But I'm pleased to convey to you that I believe our company is turning a corner and heading in a very positive direction with each of our development programs.
In response to the pandemic, we have taken measures to support the durable advancement of our pipeline, ensure patient safety and the integrity of the data from our clinical studies and manage our finances in a responsible manner. All of these internal efforts and the relentless dedication of our team have collectively resulted in key positive developments across our pipeline and company over the past few months.
