Good morning and welcome to the Acreage Holdings Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.

Steve West
Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Acreage Holdings third quarter conference call. Joining me today are Bill Van Faasen, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Glen Leibowitz, our Chief Financial Officer.
This call is being recorded and will be archived on our Investor Relations website at investors.acreageholdings.com. Today's call contains forward-looking statements subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Any such statements should be taken in conjunction with cautionary statements in our press release and risk factor discussions in our public filings found on SEDAR and EDGAR, as well as our investor website. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we assume no obligation to update them.
I want to touch briefly on a change to our earnings reporting process that will take place beginning with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings cycle. We will still post our earnings press release and financial slide after the market. Additionally, we'll post management's prerecorded discussion on the quarter. We will then host a live conference call for question-and-answers with analyst the following morning at 8:30 AM as usual. We believe this is a more efficient use of both our time and our analysts time and gives our analysts and investors quicker access to all of the information.
Now, for your future scheduling purposes, our fourth quarter earnings release financial slides and prerecorded management discussion is tentatively scheduled to be issued after the market close on March 9, 2021 and our live Q&A with analyst is the morning of March 10th, 2021.
I will now turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Van Faasen
Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. It's been a very busy quarter for everyone at Acreage and I'm pleased to be able to update our shareholders on some of the progress on our refocused strategy. As indicated in the third quarter earnings release we issued last night. Our plan is working. Our fundamental continue to improve both sequentially and year-over-year. We made significant balance sheet improvements and we delivered some tangible wins across our entire operations group including our brand portfolio, dispensary openings and cultivation build outs and expansions.
The cannabis industry continues to adapt and thrive in the new normal world of operating in a pandemic. Acreage like the rest of industry continues to experience higher sales levels than before COVID related quarantine protocols were implemented. I'm pleased that Acreage is able to report improving fundamentals when so many businesses and other consumer and retail sectors continue to struggle.
Before going into details in our third quarter I want to briefly touch on last week's election results. At the federal level, our internal view has always been regardless of which party won the Presidential election or control the House and Senate. The momentum was building faster than ever toward federal permissibility for cannabis. We congratulate President-elect Biden on his win and look forward to his team's leadership on cannabis reform policy.
