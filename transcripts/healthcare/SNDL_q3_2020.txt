Good morning, and welcome to Sundial Growers' Third quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, Sundial issued a press release announcing their financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. This press release is available on the company's website at sndlgroup.com and filed on EDGAR and SEDAR as well. 
Presenting on this morning's call, we have Zach George, Chief Executive Officer; Jim Keough, Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Stordeur, President and Chief Operating Officer.
Before we start, I would like to remind investors that certain matters discussed in today's conference call or answers that may be given to questions could constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. Risk factors that could affect results are detailed in the company's financial reports and other public filings that are made available on SEDAR and EDGAR. Additionally, all financial figures mentioned are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. I'd also like to note that we are conducting the call today from our respective remote locations. As such, there may be brief delays, crosstalk or minor technical issues during this call. We thank you in advance for your patience and understanding. 
We will now make prepared remarks, and then we'll move on to the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Zach George.

Thank you everyone for joining us on our third quarter 2020 earnings call. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect global markets and people around the world, we hope that everyone is staying safe during this unprecedented time. Health and safety continues to be of priority at Sundial. We remain committed to stringent procedures to ensure the protection of our employees and consumers while minimising disruption to our operations. To-date, Sundial has not experienced any material disruptions related to COVID-19.
As we enter the last month of 2020 and plan for the future, some context and perspective may be helpful. The Canadian cannabis industry is complex and still in its infancy. We're just two years into legalization and Sundial is about 22 months into commercial operations. Much of our competition is at a multiyear head start on Sundial. In a short time frame, we've been able to connect with consumers, capture meaningful market share and quickly become competitive in a rapidly evolving marketplace.
Following the change in our management team and subsequent financial restructuring, we have drastically improved our operating practices targeting a sustainable cost structure and a simplified, more focused business model. We entered 2020 with optimistic projections and a severely challenged capital structure. We have since taken aggressive steps to de-risk our balance sheet through a combination of cash repayments, asset sales, and debt for equity swaps. A total of $100 million in total debt has been eliminated on a year-to-date basis. We have also reduced annualized cash debt service obligations by approximately $31 million. In addition, we currently have approximately $60 million in cash on hand and access to capital if required.
Our restructuring has required significant dilution, but we are well-funded through 2021. We expect the current rate of dilution to decline into Q1 2021 as the last of our convertible debt is extinguished. Under current operating conditions, we do not require additional capital in the near-term unless we engage in a material strategic transaction. While we will not comment on the process itself, our previously announced strategic review is active and continues to be a focus.
