This afternoon Alpine Immune Sciences issued a press release announcing the company's third quarter 2020 financial results and corporate updates. If you have not received this news release and would like to read it, or you would simply like to be added to the company's distribution list, you can do both on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at www.alpineimmunesciences.com.
During the course of today's conference call, Alpine's management will make forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding the anticipated impacts and timing of the COVID-19 pandemic on Alpine's business, development plans and timelines and results of operations, the company's preclinical and clinical development plans and the timing thereof, expectations regarding the sufficiency of cash to fund operations including any cash received from potential milestone payments under Alpine's collaborations, the timing and publication of future clinical data, expectations regarding Alpine's ongoing collaborations and potential future collaborations, including the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Option and Licensing Agreement between Alpine and AbbVie for the development and commercialization of ALPN-101, Alpine's ability to successfully develop its product candidates and achieve milestones under it's collaboration with AbbVie and others, Alpine's future development plans, addressable markets, regulatory success and commercial potential of Alpine's or it's collaborators' product candidates, and the financial and business outlook for Alpine.
These forward-looking statements are based on the company's current expectations and inherently involves significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements, as a result of these risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause results to be different from these statements also include factors the company describes in the section entitled Risk Factors in Alpine's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020, and filed with the SEC on or about November 12, 2020. Alpine cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no obligation or duty to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes and its expectations.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Alpine's, Executive Chairman and CEO, Dr. Mitchell Gold.
