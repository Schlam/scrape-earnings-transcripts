Thank you, Dan and thanks everyone for joining our call this afternoon. I will provide a business update and then ask Deepak to provide an update on our Phase 3 clinical program, and then Mike will review the financial results we reported earlier today.
We continue to build positive momentum on our lead program, developing sofpironium bromide as a best -- potential best-in-class treatment option for primary axillary hyperhidrosis or more commonly described as excessive underarm sweating. Several recent achievements have put us on a clear path forward for this program, with a set of near-term milestones on the horizon.
Let me take a minute to -- just to touch on some of the -- our recently achieved milestones before I turn it over to Deepak to offer more detail on our Phase 3 program. First, we initiated the Phase 3 Cardigan 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied sofpironium bromide gel 15% for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Enrollment is going as planned.
Additionally, we remain on track to initiate the second Phase 3 study Cardigan 2 before the end of the year. We anticipate announcing top line results from these studies in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We completed an equity financing round with net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million. This additional capital strengthens our balance sheet, and it is expected to fully fund our operations beyond top line results of the U.S. pivotal Phase 3 program.
As previously mentioned during our last call, in July we completed our 12-month Phase 3 open-label long-term safety study, evaluating sofpironium bromide gel 5% and 15%, which confirmed both concentrations were safe and generally well tolerated. This data is consistent with our earlier Phase 2 clinical trial results. We expect to release additional details at an upcoming scientific forum.
