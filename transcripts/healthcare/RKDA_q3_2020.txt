Matthew Plavan
Thank you everyone for joining us, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Since our last call, I'm pleased to report Arcadia achieved a number of fundamental milestones, resulting in a more focused execution strategy, and a tangibly strengthened financial ability to achieve our number one goal to drive near-term shareholder value by unlocking the full potential of our commercial ready products today.
Allow me to highlight these important achievements. First, as we announced this morning, we have consolidated the forward commercialization of our HB4 soybean, soybean business with our business partner Bioseries, in exchange for cash and just under 1.9 million shares in Bioseries, providing Arcadia with both additional liquidity for its other business initiatives, as well as a meaningful stake in Arcadia, thereby preserving our share of an upside and the performance of the HB4 soybean. Also, as part of this transaction Bioseries acquired the license rights to our GoodWheat product portfolio which will extend our global reach into South and Central America and important wheat growing region.
Second, we completed the acquisition of Industrial Seed Innovations or ISI. And we've successfully integrated breeding activities and their Northwestern production operations with our operations in Central California that are now laying the groundwork for sales in 2021, leveraging their installed base and strong reputation for quality genetics and grower support.
And third, just this week, we formally launched our direct-to-consumer GoodWheat products with our partner three farm daughters into both regional grocers in the U.S. and an online e-commerce cart made possible only by the hard work over the past 90 days by our employees and our partners, putting into place from scratch so to speak, the milling, co-packing, an e-commerce logistics infrastructure required to serve our global markets. The more experience we get in the commercialization of the products of GoodWheat, the higher is our confidence that our GoodWheat trades will be a blockbuster success.
Unequivocally, the feedback from our B2B partners like Bay State Milling, Arden, Teva, GoodMill innovation, as well as our supply chain partners who work with us to formulate our wheat into food products is that good wheat is remarkably unique, because of what we like to think of as the innovation trifecta, which is one, its nutritional content is superior, with unparalleled levels of intrinsic fiber; two, its food formulation, performance is exceptional; and three, it tastes delicious, which we know through direct consumer feedback that's pouring in since our launch.
