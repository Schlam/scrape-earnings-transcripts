Thank you, Hans. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. 
We're pleased to report record revenue and ongoing reductions in operating expenses and cash burn for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.
Brian will cover the financials in detail, but I wanted to begin with a few highlights. First, we generated total third quarter revenue of approximately $1.1 million, representing an increase of 44% sequentially and 58% over the third quarter of 2019.
We're still in the very early stages of commercializing gammaCore non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation therapy, or nVNS and we are pleased to see a renewed ability to grow revenue against a backdrop of COVID-19, demonstrating that we are adapting successfully to the new normal.
During the third quarter, we saw a resumption of growth in all three of our primary revenue channels, the Department of Veterans Affairs, commercial prescriptions in the United States and in the United Kingdom.
Notably, we were able to achieve these results while continuing to manage our spending and balance sheet aggressively.
During the third quarter, we used $4.1 million in cash to fund our operations. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26 million, which we believe provides substantial runway and resources to support a number of important and potentially value creating milestones.
