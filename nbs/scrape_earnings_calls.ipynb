       " <p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Hannes Wittig</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our third quarter 2020 conference call. With me today are our CEO, Tim Höttges, and our CFO, Christian Illek. Tim, as usual, will first go through a few highlights year-to-date, including our raised guidance. And this will be followed by Christian who will talk about the quarter's financials in more detail. And then, we have time for Q&amp;A. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">And as usual, before I hand over to Tim, please pay attention to our disclaimer which you'll find in the presentation. And now, it's my great pleasure to hand over to Tim.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\"><strong>Timotheus Höttges</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">High-five, guys. So, welcome from my side here for great quarter of Deutsche Telekom. Another good outlook for the remainder of the year and the future we're having. I want to share some of the highlights with you today and our strong results, which we have presented earlier this morning. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">As usual, my overview will be followed then by Christian and then we go deeper into the questionnaires. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">This was a good quarter, as I mentioned, on both sides of the Atlantic. Strong commercials, a lot of progress with the merger and underlying strong financials. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">The most important thing for me, we are growing, and this despite COVID. I think this tanker is on its way through a storm and in a very, very clear way. And I'm very happy about commitment of our people to this. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">We're investing, at the same time, with €17 billion, record high levels. And this despite COVID. So, we are not negatively entangled by that.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">In the US, we made great progress with the Sprint integration. You saw the numbers already. And with the rollout of our 5G services. We are well ahead of AT&amp;T and Verizon. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">We raised our full-year guidance. On this side of the Atlantic, we continue to deliver commercial and financial growth. And here, too, we raised our full-year guidance as well. So, that makes it a good story for whole Deutsche Telekom. Germany has grown, 16 quarters, EBITDA in a row now. And the Euro segment grows 11 quarters in a row. So, I think that shows you the good performance. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">Our commercials remain strong. We added 97,000 broadband customers in Germany. On the broadband side, our line losses are down by two-thirds, 45,000. So, this is almost nothing this quarter compared to the history. And we achieved a Grand Slam of German service awards. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">Look, I would say every company, every telco would name them. We have so many awards that I cannot list them here. But I will definitely do that in the Capital Markets Day. I show you at least how we are outperforming our competition. And just today, we got another award. There was a big network drive test made in seven categories. Deutsche Telekom won six out of them. So, from a network perspective, there's no one as even close to our performance these days. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"p p1\">We ended the benchmark wholesale agreement with Telefónica Deutschland, which is helping us to improve our commercials around the FTTH rollout going forward, and this is even helping us big time in our credibility towards regulators. </p>]"
